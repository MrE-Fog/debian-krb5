Mon Jul 31 15:47:30 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* kdb5_edit.c - Use libkadm string conversion routines.  These are
		shared by all utilities.
	* Makefile.in - Remove getdate.y.
	* configure.in - Remove getdate.y dependency checks.
	* getdate.y - Sayonara.


Thu Jul 27 15:01:01 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* configure.in - Add --with-dbm and check for already checking for dbm.


Thu Jul 27 02:59:05 1995   Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

        * dump.c kdb5_edit.c kdb5_edit.h util.c : Use new kdb format.

Mon Jul 17 15:00:08 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* configure.in - Add KADM library.
	* dumpv4.c - Change calling sequence to krb5_db_fetch_mkey().
	* kdb5_edit.c - Change calling sequence to krb5_db_fetch_mkey() which
		uses the stash file.  Add KDC profile reading/handling as a
		supplement to command line supplied arguments.


Wed Jul 12 12:01:04 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* configure.in - Temporarily add --with-kdb4 option.  Default is without
		kdb4.  Without kdb4 enables a define.  With kdb4 uses -lkdb4 and
		-l[n]dbm libraries.
	* dumpv4.c -  Conditionalize references to kdb4 routines with
		KDB4_DISABLE.  Replace two required routines:
			kdb_encrypt_key -> pcbc_encrypt
			kdb_get_master_key -> des_read_password/printf/key_sched


Fri Jul 7 15:38:00 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in - Remove all explicit library handling and LDFLAGS.
	* configure.in - Add USE_<mumble> and KRB5_LIBRARIES.


Thu Jun 15 15:34:59 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
        * Makefile.in - Change explicit library names to -l<lib> form, and
                change target link line to use $(LD) and associated flags.
                Also, for K4, use KRB4_LIB and KRB4_CRYPTO_LIB, these wer
                split out.
        * configure.in - Add shared library usage check.

Fri Jun  9 18:14:43 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

Sun May 21 14:20:32 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* dumpv4.c: Include k5-int.h before krb.h so that PROTOTYPE is not
		redefined.

	* configure.in: just use WITH_KRB4.

Wed Apr 19 13:59:47 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* kdb5_edit.c (kdb5_edit_Init): If a default realm is specified
		(with -r), use krb5_set_default_realm so that created keys
		will have the correct realm.

Thu Mar 23 23:28:26 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* kdb5_edit.c (show_principal, parse_princ_args): Add

Tue Feb 14 17:55:47 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* kdb5_edit.c: add modent
	* getdate.y: import get_date
	* kdbt_ed_ct.ct: add modent

Mon Dec 19 18:04:11 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.in:
	* dumpv4.c (dump_v4db): Do the right thing if we are compiling
		without V4 support.  (The dump_v4db command is disabled.)

Wed Dec  7 00:07:46 1994    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* dumpv4.c (v4_print_time): gmtime expects a pointer to a time_t,
		not a long. On most systems these are the same, on
		others.... 

Wed Nov 16 01:03:42 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* dumpv4.c: new file. New command dump_v4db which creates a v4
	slave dump out of a v5 database, leaving out any keys which aren't
	using v4 salt, and any keys that aren't for the current
	realm. Reencrypts using v4 master key, synthesizes arbitrary
	master key version number.
	* configure.in: use WITH_KRB4 for dump support.
	* kdb5_ed_ct.ct: add new dump_v4 command.
	* Makefile.in: link in dumpv4.

Fri Oct 14 23:31:49 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* dump.c (load_db): When scanning a database entry, read
		fail_auth_count into a temporary integer variable, and
		then copy that into entry.fail_auth_count, which is a
		char.  

Fri Oct  7 00:01:40 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* kdb5_edit.c (kdb5_edit_Init): Don't let errors in
		set_dbname_help initially cause the exit status to be set.
		Commands like load_db don't need a valid database to be
		opened.

	* ss_wrapper.c (main): Clear code before ss_execute_line, since
		ss_execute_line doesn't set code to 0 if there are no
	problems. 

	* kdb5_edit.c (kdb5_edit_Init): Add a new option so that the
		master key password can be entered on the command line ---
		for testing only; not documented!!

Mon Oct  3 19:10:47 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in: Use $(srcdir) to find manual page for make install.

Thu Sep 29 15:52:22 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* dump.c (update_ok_file): Make sure mod time on the dump_ok file
		is updated.  (Some systems don't update the mod-time when
		a file is opened for writing.)

	* Makefile.in: Relink executable when libraries change.

	* kdb5_edit.c (show_principal): Pass variable with correct type to
		ctime().

	* tcl_wrapper.c (doquit):
	  ss_wrapper.c (main):
	  kdb5_edit.c:
	  dump.c: Exit with a non-zero exit status if there was an error
	  	  in a executed command.

Thu Sep 15 11:00:30 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* dump.c (load_db): Fix error string on failed fopen. ("for
		writing" -> "for reading")

	* dump.c (load_db): When scanning a database entry, read
		fail_auth_count into a temporary integer variable, and
		then copy that into entry.fail_auth_count, which is a
		char.  

Fri Oct  7 00:01:40 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* kdb5_edit.c (kdb5_edit_Init): Don't let errors in
		set_dbname_help initially cause the exit status to be set.
		Commands like load_db don't need a valid database to be
		opened.

	* ss_wrapper.c (main): Clear code before ss_execute_line, since
		ss_execute_line doesn't set code to 0 if there are no
	problems. 

	* kdb5_edit.c (kdb5_edit_Init): Add a new option so that the
		master key password can be entered on the command line ---
		for testing only; not documented!!

	* dump.c (update_ok_file): Make sure mod time on the dump_ok file
		is updated.  (Some systems don't update the mod-time when
		a file is opened for writing.)

	* Makefile.in: Relink executable when libraries change.

	* kdb5_edit.c (show_principal): Pass variable with correct type to
		ctime().

	* tcl_wrapper.c (doquit):
	  ss_wrapper.c (main):
	  kdb5_edit.c:
	  dump.c: Exit with a non-zero exit status if there was an error
	  	  in a executed command.

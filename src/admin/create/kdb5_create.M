.SH DESCRIPTION
.I kdb5_create
is used to create an empty Kerberos version 5 principal database.
The user is prompted for the master password, which will be used to
generate an encryption key under which all entries are stored (in order
to provide some security against database theft).
.PP
The
.B \-r
.I realm
option specifies the realm for which the database should be created;
by default the realm returned by
.IR krb5_default_local_realm (3)
is used.
.PP
The
.B \-d
.I dbname
option specifies the name under which the principal database is to be
created; by default the database is in DEFAULT_DBM_FILE (normally
/krb5/principal).
.PP
The
.B \-k
.I keytype
option specifies the key type (as an ascii representation of a decimal
number) of the master key in the database; the default is KEYTYPE_DES.
.PP
The
.B \-M
.I mkeyname
option specifies the principal name for the master key in the database;
the default is KRB5_KDB_M_NAME (usually "K/M" in the KDC's realm).
.PP
The
.B \-e
.I enctype
option specifies the encryption type (as an ascii representation of a decimal
number) to be used when placing entries in
the database; the default is the default encryption type for the master
keytype.

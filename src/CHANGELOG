Compilation changes for the NeXT, AIX.

Fix RCP so it copies files using the uid of the user.

Fix KRB5_INCSUBDIRS, so that the include files are installed correctly.

Fix V4 krb.h file so that it will find the other V4 include files.

Fix POSIX/non-POSIX signal type handling in kadmin server.

Remove extraneous log() in V4 compatibility code.

Fix compat_recv.c so that it will look for krb.h in the right place.

krb5_free_kdc_rep() was being called twice in some error return cases
in krb5_get_in_tkt().  Fixed.

krb5_principal2salt_norealm().  [tytso:19940311.1758EST]

KDC wasn't handling postdated tickets requested via an initial ticket
request correctly.  It should have been setting the POSTDATED flag as
well as the INVALID flag.  [tytso:19940312.0015EST]

Fixed get_in_tkt so that all memory is freed on error returns.
[tytso:19940312.0101EST]

Don't allow null passwords in kpasswd.

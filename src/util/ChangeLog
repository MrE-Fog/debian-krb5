	* Makefile.in: Don't use $< in a non suffix rule context.

Tue Nov  1 14:49:00 1994    (tytso@rsx-11)

	* libupdate.sh: Use library.stamp to determine whether or not
		$arcmd needs to be rerun. 

	* libupdate.sh: touch the library first, before running $aradd, in
		case changing the mod time of the library after running
		$aradd causes problems on some systems.

	* libupdate.sh: Change use of "head -1" to "sed 1q"

	* configure.in: 
	* Makefile.in:
	* libupdate.sh: Add support for the new libupdate shell script.
		It automatically updates a library from a file listing of
		constituent .o files.  It only calls "ar" if it absolutely
		has to, in order to speed things up for partial
		recompilations.  (ar is dreadfully slow if you're using
		one based on the BFD library.)

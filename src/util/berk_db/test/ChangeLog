Wed Jun 28 00:17:44 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* run.test: look in /usr/share/lib/dict/words to find the words
	file under SGI Irix 5.

Fri Jun 16 16:57:24 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* run.test - Remove argument processing loop and only do the first one
		because Ultrix' /bin/sh5 is lame.


Tue Jun 13 16:00:18 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* dbtest.c - Check for HAVE_INDEX.  If we have it, then use it,
		otherwise use strchr.
	* configure.in - check for index(3).
	* Makefile.in - check for /bin/sh5, if present, use it because some
		system's /bin/sh doesn't understand some Bourne shell syntax.

Sun Jun 11 02:33:32 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* configure.in: fix intial value of CDEFS_INCLUDE so that make
		check doesn't end up with a "-I "

	* configure.in: Remove standardized set of autoconf macros, which
		are now handled by CONFIG_RULES.

Wed Jun  7 09:27:39 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@lurch.mit.edu>

	* configure.in (CDEFS_INCLUDE): /bin/sh doesn't grok $(foo); it
		wants ${foo}!

Tue May 30 10:42:06 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* configure.in: Check for sys/cdefs.h.
	* Makefile.in: If sys/cdefs.h present, don't use the one in PORT/krb5.

Tue May 30 06:30:08 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS): Added $(DEFS) so that configure determined
		CFLAGS can be included

Kerberos notes:
---------------

What is here is only a small subset of the Berkeley database code.
Only the hashed database code has been kept.

hash/krb5_ndbm.c has been added to better tune the database code to
Kerberos' large keys.  This supercedes hash/ndbm.c.

A bug in hash/hash_bigkey.c which caused deletion of elements in
collided buckets to fail or discard other collided elements has been
fixed.

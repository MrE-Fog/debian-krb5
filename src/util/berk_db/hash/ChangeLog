Thu Aug 24 18:40:48 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* .Sanitize: Update file list

Fri Jul 14 13:51:42 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@screw-loose.MIT.EDU>

	* configure.in: Implement test for pgno_t that works under NetBSD
        and Irix 5.3--possibly other systems too.

Sat Jul  1 23:15:59 1995  Tom Yu  <tlyu@lothlorien.MIT.EDU>

	* configure.in: Don't check for pgno_t; it's not in sys/types.h on
		any system I've seen, and it breaks the following check
		for datum.dsize under netbsd.

Fri Jun 30 14:49:53 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* configure.in - Add shared library object rule.
	* Makefile.in - Add shared library object rules.

Wed Jun 28 00:18:16 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: use AC_CHECK_FUNCS and check for memmove.
	hash.h: if we don't HAVE_MEMMOVE use bcopy.

Tue Jun 27 20:50:57 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: *int*_t are likely to collide with native types,
	and the int8_t and *int64_t are never used anyway, so push them
	off to hash/configure.in AC_CHECK_TYPE calls. pgno_t also.


Tue Jun 27 15:47:56 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* hash.c - Cast 2nd argument to memmove to (char *).

Fri Jun  9 18:59:55 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Remove standardized set of autoconf macros, which
		are now handled by CONFIG_RULES.

Wed Jun  7 09:26:28 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@lurch.mit.edu>

	* configure.in (CDEFS_INCLUDE): /bin/sh doesn't grok $(foo); it
		wants ${foo}!

Tue May 30 10:41:23 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* configure.in: Check for sys/cdefs.h.
	* Makefile.in: If sys/cdefs.h present, don't use the one in PORT/krb5.

Tue May 30 09:53:05 1995  Ezra Peisach  (epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu)

	* krb5_ndbm.c: If the size field of datum and DBT do not match,
		then passing structures subject to stack garbage. Copy
		instaead. 

	* configure.in: Determine the size of the datum and DBT size
		fields.

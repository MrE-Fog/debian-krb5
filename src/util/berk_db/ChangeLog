Fri Oct  6 22:06:14 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in: Remove ##DOS!include of config/windows.in.
		config/windows.in is now included by wconfig.

Mon Oct  2 14:38:37 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (check-unix): Changed building of library from check
		to check-unix.

Mon Sep 25 16:43:28 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in: Removed "foo:: foo-$(WHAT)" lines from the
		Makefile. 

Mon Sep 18 08:35:47 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (check): Only build libdb.a when making the self
		checks. Do not install the library.

	* configure.in: Do not build a shared library - the contents are
		already merged into libkrb5.

Thu Aug 24 18:40:48 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* .Sanitize: Update file list

Tue Jul 18 21:57:52 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@screw-loose.MIT.EDU>

	* configure.in: Don't depend on libdb_ranlib.

Tue Jul 18 18:04:21 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (install): Combine the ranlib in with the rest of
        the rule.  This cleans up the $(STEXT) rule.

Thu Jul 13 16:24:07 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (clean-unix): Use libdb.$(STEXT) so that it works
        under AIX.

Fri Jul 7 16:41:17 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in - Add DEPLIBS, needed by shared library rule.

Mon Jul  3 12:11:51 1995  Tom Yu  <tlyu@lothlorien.MIT.EDU>

	* Makefile.in (libdb.a): Quiet the if statement.

	* configure.in: Symlink $(TOPLIBD)/libdb.* from the right place.

Fri Jun 30 14:47:53 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* configure.in - Add --enable-shared check for building libdb shared.
		While we won't use libdb shared explicitly, we might as well
		build it since we have to go through the trouble of building
		the shared objects for libkrb5.
	* Makefile.in - Add shared library rules.

Fri Jun  9 18:59:23 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Remove standardized set of autoconf macros, which
		are now handled by CONFIG_RULES.  Use DO_SUBDIRS to
		recurse down subdirectories.


Fri May 26 16:07:52 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	Bring in version 1.85 of the Berkeley database code.  We only
	use the hashed database, so that's all that's here.  There are
	slight modifications to the code to fix one bug and to tailor
	it for usage with Kerberos.

	Bring in version 1.85 of the Berkeley database code.  We only
	use the hashed database, so that's all that's here.  There are
	slight modifications which were done to the code.

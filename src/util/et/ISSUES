Issues to be addressed for src/util/et: -*- text -*-

Non-thread-safe aspects:

error_message uses a static buffer for "unknown error code" messages;
a per-thread buffer may be better, but that depends on dynamic
allocation working.  A caller-provided buffer would be best, but
that's a API change.

initialize_foo_error_table uses a global linked list hung off an
unprotected variable in the library.  {add,remove}_error_table do
likewise, but can be changed without externally visible effect.

Workaround: Use a global lock for all calls to error_message and
com_err, and when adding or removing error tables.

API divergence:

Transarc and Heimdal both have APIs that are different from this
version.  (Specifics?)

Workaround:

No reference counting:

If libraries are dynamically loaded and unloaded, and the init/fini
functions add and remove error tables for *other* libraries they
depend on (e.g., if a dynamically loadable Zephyr library's fini
function removes the krb4 library error table and then dlcloses the
krb4 library, while another dlopen reference keeps the krb4 library
around), the error table is gone, even if the library is still in use.

Workaround: None.

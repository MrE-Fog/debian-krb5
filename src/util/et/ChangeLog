	* Makefile.in: remove spurious whitespace from blank line

Fri Apr 14 08:48:00 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* com_err.h: If FAR is not defined, define it away.

Thu Apr 13 16:02:24 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

        * com_err.c, compile_et.c, error_ta.h, et_c.awk, internal.h:
           __STDC__ conditionals also checks for the _WINDOWS define.

Wed Apr 5 16:25:35 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* com_err.h: added FAR to pointers in prototypes.

Wed Mar 29 08:56:47 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Fix up Mac makefile.
	* error_message.c:  For errno, use strerror if HAS_STRERROR.
	* configure.in:  Define HAS_STRERROR.

Thu Mar 23 19:00:03 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* com_err.c (default_com_err_proc): Fixed breakage introduced by
		windows port.  com_err() is supposed to print a newline at
		after printing the error message!

Wed Mar 22 11:34:09 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* com_err.c: added _WINDOWS equivalent condition to HAVE_STDARG_H
 	   since windows fakes autoconf by defining such constants in
	   k5-config.h which isn't included for this file.

Thu Mar 16 19:57:20 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* com_err.c: added missing INTERFACE on a prototype.
        * com_err.h: added _WINDOWS as an equivalent to __STDC__ since this
           file gets included by windows programs in which __STDC__ isn't defined.
        * makefile.in: added xxx-mac targets to mimic xxx-unix, and added
            copying com_err.h to src\include for the PC.

Wed Mar 16 17:30:00 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* com_err.h: problem with this file needing k5-config for windows
	   stuff but many application programs don't include it. So for
	   now I've put the windows stuff that is needed directly into it.

Wed Mar 15 23:02:14 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* com_err.c: made to work on the PC. Biggest changes was that
           the error message now gets built in a buffer and either gets
           printed to stderr or for Windows gets displays in a message box.
        * err_message.c: fixed up includes and some 32/16 bit ints.
        * et_name.c: changed two ints into longs.
        * com_err.h: added windows keyword INTERFACE to prototypes.
        * error_table.h: Added some windows specific defines since this
           source doesn't really know about k5-config.h. Also, added 
           prototype for error_table_name().
	* Makefile.in: PC rules to make com_err, err_message and et_name.

Tue Feb 28 13:23:58 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* error_table.h: Remove #ifdef STDC check to see if we should use
		const --- configure takes care of this.

Tue Feb 28 01:35:14 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* com_err.3:  Document "com_err.h" rather than <com_err.h>.

Fri Feb  3 08:11:26 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* com_err.h: All routines defined in the com_err library should
		have extern before the prototypes.   (Required for SGI
		platform).

Wed Jan 25 20:48:50 1995  Mark Eichin  (eichin@tweedledumber.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (SRCS): add com_err.c explicit dependency to work
	around VPATH bug in Solaris make. Also fix typo in comment.

Fri Nov 18 00:34:29 1994  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: add caching to perror check (from epeisach).

Fri Oct 21 21:06:48 1994    (tytso@rsx-11)

	* Makefile.in (SED): Don't specify an explicit pathname for sed.

Tue Oct 11 12:43:00 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in: Don't rm the awk and sed scripts during a make clean!

Thu Oct  6 19:39:11 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* compile_et.sh: Replace basename with sed -- more portable.

Mon Oct  3 17:27:28 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in:
	  configure.in: Don't try to compile compile_et.  Use awk/sed
	  	  version instead.  It's more apt to be portable, since it
		  doesn't use awk or sed.  :-(
	

Fri Sep 30 17:12:15 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* compile_et.c: Add declaration of error_message() manually.

	* internal.h: Use autoconf to determine whether or not to declare
		perror().

	* configure.in:
	  compiler.h:
	  internal.h:
	  compilet_et.c:
	  init_et.c: Let configure take care of removing const with AC_CONST.

Thu Sep  8 22:33:07 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@pinata)

	* com_err.c (default_com_err_proc): Reversed order of \n\r to make
		jik happy.

Wed Jul 13 23:19:34 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in: nuke the libcom_err.a.bak stuff

Sun Jul  3 07:48:04 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in: cleaning up to not spew ignored errors

Wed Jun 22 18:47:36 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@tweedledumber.cygnus.com)

	* com_err.h: Only set STDARG_PROTOTYPES based on STDC if it isn't
	set already (clean up warnings.)

Wed Jun 22 17:55:48 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (CP): set CP so CopySrcHeader actually works.

Tue Jun 21 00:20:44 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in: add "includes" to "all" dependencies

	* configure.in: should be CopySrcHeader

Mon Jun 20 21:59:37 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* configure.in: install com_err.h during build

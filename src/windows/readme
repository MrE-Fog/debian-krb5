Windows Kerberos 5

Here are the steps for making the Windows version of Kerberos 5.

On the Unix side
1) cd xxx/src                          # Go to where the source lives
2) make -f Makefile.in kerbsrc.zip     # Does some Unix-side configuring
                                       # ...and creates kerbsrc.zip
3) <transfer kerbsrc.zip to the PC>


On the PC side
1) md \k5                              # Create where we'll put the tree
2) cd \k5
3) unzip kerbsrc.zip
        - or -
   pkunzip -d kerbsrc.zip

4) nmake -c                            # Configures the makefiles and runs
                                       # ...make in all the subdirectories.

5) mkbin			       # This will run a patch file which
				       # collects the DLL's and executables
                                       # generated by the build procedure
                                       # and place them in the kbin directory

6) <make sure the configuration file krb5.ini is in the \windows or \winnt 
    directory.>

Windows Kerberos 5

Here are the steps for making the Windows version of Kerberos 5.

On the Unix side
1) cd xxx/src                          # Go to where the source lives
2) make -f Makefile.in kerbsrc.zip     # Does some Unix-side configuring
                                       # ...and creates kerbsrc.zip
3) <transfer kerbsrc.zip to the PC>


On the PC side
1) md \k5                              # Create where we'll put the tree
2) cd \k5
3) unzip kerbsrc.zip
        - or -
   pkunzip -d kerbsrc.zip

4) nmake -c -f makefile.in             # Configures the makefiles and runs
                                       # ...make in all the subdirectories.
5) <make sure the config and realms files, krb.con and krb.rea, 
    are in the top level directory.>

The resulting interesting files will be:
lib/libkrb5.dll                        # The actual DLL
lib/libkrb5.lib                        # The library for linking in the DLL
windows/cns/cns.exe                    # Cygnus Network Security program
windows/wintel/telnet                  # K5 authenticated telnet program

Note on telnet: since the only k5 telnet daemon at this time is 
tsx-11.mit.edu port 13131, the port the program connects to is
hardwired for now to 13131.

	* telnet.c: bug fix with saving/restoring delete versus backspace.

Fri Apr 7 15:14:07 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* telnet.c, wt-proto.h: port numbers better supported. You can
           now specify '<host> <port>' in the initial dialog. This gets
           saved in the ini file.

Wed Apr 5 16:18:30 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* screen.c, screen.h, dialog.h, telnet.rc: added an about 
           box with version number.

	* telnet.c, wt-proto.h: added command line option to set port number
           so port is no longer wired to 13131.
        * auth.c: made the k4/k5 separation cleaner

Mon Mar 27 20:18:41 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Initial release based upon the K4 version. 
        * K4 streams layer is replaced with no-ops in k5stream.c
        * only one-way authentication tested since a telnet daemon which
           does mutual is not available.
        * connect port is hard-wired to 13131 for now since that is the
           port of the only available K5 telnet daemon (tsx-11.mit.edu)

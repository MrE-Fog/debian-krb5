	* Initial release based upon the K4 version. 
        * K4 streams layer is replaced with no-ops in k5stream.c
        * only one-way authentication tested since a telnet daemon which
           does mutual is not available.
        * connect port is hard-wired to 13131 for now since that is the
           port of the only available K5 telnet daemon (tsx-11.mit.edu)

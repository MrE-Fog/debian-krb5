.SH DESCRIPTION
.I kadmind5
is the network database server for the Kerberos version 5
password-changing and administration tools.

.SH FLAGS
.PP
.B Database, Key and Realm flags
.IP \-r 
.B realm
specifies the realm that this server is to administer.  The default is
the local realm.
.IP \-d
.B dbname
specifies the location of the database.
.IP \-M
.B mkeyname
specifies the name of the master key.
.IP \-k
.B mkeytype
specifies the master key type.
.IP \-i
Indicates that the master key name is to be entered interactively.
.IP \-e
.B enctype
specifies the encryption type which is to be used.
.PP
.B ACL flag
.IP \-a
.B aclfile
specifies the location of the ACL file.  This file controls remote
principals' abilities to perform administrative functions.  See the
ACL FILE section below for the format of this file.
.PP
.B Connection flag
.IP \-t
Indicates that the server is to terminate a connection if it remains
inactive for
.B timeout
seconds.
.PP
.B Debugging flag
.IP \-D
Enables certain debugging features and messages selected by
.B debugmask.
.PP
.B Protocol Message flags
.IP \-l
.B langlist
specifies the list of supported language names [not implemented].
.IP \-m
Enables (
.B 1
) or disables (
.B 0
) MIME encoding support [not implemented].

.SH ACL FILE
.PP
The ACL file controls which principals can or cannot perform which
administrative functions.  This file can contain comment lines, null
lines or lines which contain ACL entries.  Comment lines start with
the sharp sign (
.B \#
) and continue until the end of the line.  Lines containing ACL
entries have the format of
.B principal
.I whitespace
.B operation-mask.
Ordering is important.  The first matching entry is the one which will
control access for a particular principal.
.PP
.IP principal
may specify a partially or fully qualified Kerberos version 5
principal name.  Each component of the name may be wildcarded using
the asterick (
.B *
) character.
.IP operation-mask
Specifies what operations may or may not be peformed by a principal
matching a particular entry.  This is a string of one or more of the
following list of characters or their upper-case counterparts.  If the
character is upper-case, then the operation is disallowed.  If the
character is lower-case, then the operation is permitted.
.TP i
.I a
[Dis]allows the addition of principals from the database.
.TP i
.I d
[Dis]allows the deletion of principals from the database.
.TP i
.I m
[Dis]allows the modification of principals in the database.
.TP i
.I c
[Dis]allows the changing of passwords for principals in the database.
.TP i
.I o

.I * o
A catchall entry.  The

	* srv_output.c (lang_error_message): Local variable is assigned
		from error_message() which returns a const char *. Should
		be assigned to same.

Tue May 9 15:29:10 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	Add new administrative protocol support functions and fix bugs.
	* kadm5_defs.h	- Add extract operation.  Move error subcodes
			  to adm.h.  Update prototypes.
	* kadmind5.M	- Add descriptions of -n, -p and -T options.  Change
			  name of -i to -m option.  Add description of
			  'e' acl entry.
	* passwd.c	- Make passwd_check_npass_ok a global routine.
	* proto_serv.c	- Use keytab supplied with -T option.  Support
			  new administrative protocol functions.  Destroy
			  replay cache when done with request.
	* srv_acl.c	- Add catchall entry which allows principals to
			  change their own passwords.  This is the last entry
			  inserted and can be overridden with an entry in
			  the ACL file.  By default, we now deny operations
			  unless there is an entry.
	* srv_key.c	- Use keytab supplied with -T option.  Actually set
			  the default realm to be the specified realm.  Return
			  salt values from key_string_to_keys().  Add random
			  key generator.

			  daemon() call if -n option is not specified.  Add
			  support for -p option.
	* srv_net.c	- Close connected socket in parent.  This was causing
			  the connection to remain open even when the child
			  was finished with it.  Add support for -p option.
			  Determine our port otherwise from the profile, and
			  then the /etc/services entry.
	* srv_output.c	- Add support for new error codes.

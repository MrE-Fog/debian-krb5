The 
.I kpasswd
command is used to change a Kerberos principal's password.

If the

option is specified, a partially or fully qualified Kerberos principal may
be supplied.  Otherwise, the principal name is derived from the identity
of the user invoking the
.I kpasswd
command.

The
.I kpasswd
command prompts for the current Kerberos password,  which is verified by the
Kerberos server.  If the old password is correct, the user is prompted twice
for the new password.  Success or failure is indicated by messages printed
out by
.I kpasswd.

	* Makefile.in (ISODELIB): Remove ISODE cruft.  Use $(LIBS) so that
		libsocket can be pulled in if necessary.

	* configure.in: Add check for libsocket and libnsl (sigh).
		krb5_init_ctx drags in cryptoconf.c, which drags in enough
		of the crypto library that socket() gets called.  We should
		to fix this eventually to make klist smaller, but the fix
		will be subtle.

	* klist.c Added -e option to print out encryption types.

	* klist.c Do a krb5_init_context() before using a krb5_context.

    * Added krb5_context to all krb5_routines

	* Makefile.in: Use $(srcdir) to find manual page for make install.

	* klist.c (main): Fix memory leak in klist --- the returned
		credentials should be freed before you fetch the next set.

Thu Jun  8 17:46:51 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* klist.c: Integrated patch from OpenVision which allows klist to
		list keytabs as well as ccache's.

Thu May 11 07:31:42 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* klist.c (main): Update usage message to include -e and -f.

	* klist.M: -e flag documented.

Thu May 04 04:24:38 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

	* klist.c : Changed progname to argv[0] for consistancy with 
		kdestroy, and to cleanup the code some.

Wed May 03 20:20:48 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

	* klist.c : #include <string.h>, a must for prototypes of various 
		string routines on systems where int != void *.

Thu Mar  2 12:31:29 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in (ISODELIB): Remove reference to $(ISODELIB).

Wed Mar  1 16:28:00 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* configure.in: Replace check for -lsocket and -lnsl with
		WITH_NETLIB check.

Tue Feb 28 02:11:02 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* klist.c:  Avoid <krb5/...> and <com_err.h> includes.

Fri Feb 10 18:44:44 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in (ISODELIB): Remove ISODE cruft.  Use $(LIBS) so that
		libsocket can be pulled in if necessary.

	* configure.in: Add check for libsocket and libnsl (sigh).
		krb5_init_ctx drags in cryptoconf.c, which drags in enough
		of the crypto library that socket() gets called.  We should
		to fix this eventually to make klist smaller, but the fix
		will be subtle.

Thu Feb 09 17:43:47 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

	* klist.c Added -e option to print out encryption types.

Fri Feb 03 22:14:26 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

	* klist.c Do a krb5_init_context() before using a krb5_context.

Fri Jan 13 15:23:47 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

    * Added krb5_context to all krb5_routines

Mon Oct  3 19:14:09 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in: Use $(srcdir) to find manual page for make install.

Thu Sep 22 22:41:42 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* klist.c (main): Fix memory leak in klist --- the returned
		credentials should be freed before you fetch the next set.

	* Makefile.in (ISODELIB): Remove ISODE cruft.  Use $(LIBS) so that
		libsocket can be pulled in if necessary.

	* kdestroy.c (main): Call krb5_init_context to initialize the
		context. 

	* configure.in: Add check for libsocket and libnsl (sigh).
		krb5_init_ctx drags in cryptoconf.c, which drags in enough
		of the crypto library that socket() gets called.  We should
		to fix this eventually to make klist smaller, but the fix
		will be subtle.

    * Added krb5_context to all krb5_routines

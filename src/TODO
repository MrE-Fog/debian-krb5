needed before beta4-patch2:

940802		stdargs/varargs breakage of ksu under SunOS
940802		ultrix appl/bsd stuff breaks (Mark?)
940802		double-check make install

not-quite-critical bug fixes:

940808		Support for DES-MD5
940802		linux port problems, e.g. broken linux headers, sgtty.h, etc.
940802		double-check telnet problems, e.g. solaris pty grabbing
940802		rethink using compile check for fopen() binary mode

future development:

940808		check file vs stdio ccache code; replace file code with stdio
940808		rewrite rcache code
940808		fold in krb4 library
940808		memory ccache
940808		support for realm name changes
940808		configuration file for krb5 clients to replace compile-time
			constants
 
cleanup for later:

940802		realloc lossage made more reasonable;  requires a compile
		and run type of check, then use REALLOC everywhere, #defined
		to check if argument is NULL first, if realloc(NULL) returns
		NULL.  This is to guard against lossage like SunOS.
940802		yank isode from tree, insert tcl subset
940802		sanity check API doc
940802		deja gnu, testing framework
940808		make depend 
940808		flush imake (and MIT DES code)
940808		make sure we're using $(MAKE) everywhere

OLD TODO LIST.  To be vetted later....



look at sandia changes (contact gmachin@somnet.sandia.gov):

	admin server

	BSD applications

	kdc/v4 changes

specific coding items:
----------------------

new protocol revision

telnet client address checking (hard to get hold of the addr?)

uuserver adds a ticket to the credentials cache each time it runs,
even if the client is using the same ticket.

KDC bulletproofing				(after beta)

KDC statistic gathering				(after beta)

admin server					(after beta)

applications
	nfs
	discuss (?)
	X11

realm "quality" code and/or hooks (tytso)	(after beta?)

alloca/tempalloc				(after beta)

test suites					(after beta)

KDC transited field comma quoting

verify that memcpy/memcmp is in use for principal names
Make sure that all comparisons of principal components (realms, etc.)
use memcmp instead of strcmp --- principal components can have nulls
in them!  (Don't blame me, blame OSI!)
	--> kdc realm transiting

code boiling between scc_ and fcc_		(after beta)

remove 32 bit dependencies (esp. in md4 and md5)	(after beta)

documentation issues:
--------------------

manual pages (programs, library)

Manual pages for appl/bsd need to be fixed!!!!

what we depend on in the system (kprop, kdc: sockets; etc)

build/installation doc:
	document expected "warnings", how to build it, configuration options
	picking up ss, com_err, makedepend, imake separately
	unifdef: ftp.uu.net:/bsd-sources/pgrm/unifdef/


operation doc
	interrealm gotchas

RFC
	DES bit ordering
	ap_rep vs. subsession keys
	assign "no meaning" #s for others?
	byte-wise comparison for principal names
	DER, "Zulu" format timestamps

bug list

testing issues:
--------------

mprof/mnemosyne

error paths

DCE interoperability




----------------------------------------------------------------

library name problems: with shared libraries cryptoconf.o can't be
replaced.  Change docs to require static linking.


----------------------------------------------------------------


Document new functions:

krb5_free_address
krb5_append_addresses
krb5_gc_via_2tgt

--------------------------------------------------------------

Bad comment message in KRB5-aux.h (KRB5-types.c should be KRB5_tables.c)

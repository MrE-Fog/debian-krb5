Sun Jul  3 07:46:25 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* aclocal.m4: fixing things so we don't have to bother ignoring
	errors.

Fri Jul  1 13:01:19 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* aclocal.m4: added WITH_CC for use when CONFIG_RULES isn't safe.
	added EXTRA_RULES_IN for chosing the file that the extra rules get
	appended to (particularly for lib/krb5/asn.1).
	made CONFIG_RULES use WITH_CC directly.

Fri Jul  1 02:21:51 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* aclocal.m4: fixes for dealing with new version of autoconf, in
	particular quoting and BUILDTOP

Wed Jun 29 01:36:38 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* aclocal.m4: oops... fixing some problems with the quoter.

	* aclocal.m4: added ISODE_DEFS to define KRB5_USE_ISODE if
	--enable-isode is given

Mon Jun 27 23:13:16 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso at tsx-11)

	* patchlevel.h: Updated to patchlevel 1.

Mon Jun 27 08:21:42 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* aclocal.m4: fixes to do sane quoting of arguments before
	recursing.  This allows options to be set with values containing
	whitespace, for instance.

	* configure.in (in all relevant subdirs): move invokations of
	CONFIG_RULES around so that they preceed anything that even
	vaguely resembles a compile test.  This is so that $CC will get
	set properly before any compile tests run.

Sat Jun 25 00:33:56 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in (in all relevant subdirs): make install will dtrt
	now (mostly)
	* configure.in (in all relevant subdirs): ditto

Thu Jun 23 01:13:20 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* aclocal.m4 (CONFIG_RULES): make --with-cc= dtrt and default to
	CC=cc

Wed Jun 22 16:34:46 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin at tweedledumber.cygnus.com)

	* aclocal.m4 (CONFIG_RULES): add AC_SUBST([CC]) so that CC gets
	nailed in correctly.

Tue Jun 21 17:46:53 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (in all subdirs): added CC=@CC@ to nail down the
	substitution to be sure that configuration matches build. Added
	CCOPTS to some of them so that it gets nailed in correctly too.

Tue Jun 21 02:08:27 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in (in all relevant subdirs): added CCOPTS=@CCOPTS@ in
	order to allow for configured default flags
	* configure.in (in all relevant subdirs): add WITH_CCOPTS
	* acloca.m4: define WITH_CCOPTS

Fri Jun 17 19:54:00 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin at cygnus.com)

	* aclocal.m4 (MAKE_SUBDIRS): pass CCOPTS, CC in every make
	* Makefile.in: change CFLAGS = -g ... to CFALGS = $(CCOPTS) ...
	  in all Makefile.in's throughout the tree.

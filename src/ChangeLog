		allows a special linker to be specified.  Useful for
		running programs like Purify, etc.		

Thu Feb 9 15:42:00 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

		KRB5_KRB4_COMPAT.

Fri Nov 18 15:38:42 1994  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* aclocal.m4 (CHECK_WAIT_TYPE, CHECK_SIGNALS, CHECK_SETJMP,
	KRB5_UTPID, KRB5_UTTYPE, KRB5_UTHOST, KRB5_UTEXIT): use
	AC_TRY_COMPILE instead of AC_TRY_LINK.
	(CHECK_FCNTL): check for 1+O_RDONLY so we aren't fooled into

Fri Nov 18 00:31:43 1994  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

		setjmp handling and POSIX signal handling.

Wed Nov  2 20:39:14 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in: We're probably not going to be building in the
		top-level directory, but even so, the CFLAGS should
		include $(DEFS).

		down to subdirectories.

	* aclocal.m4 (CONFIG_RULES, WITH_CPPOPTS): Add support for a new
		"--with-cppopts" value where you can put -DXXXXX such that
		they are found by autoconf tests that use run the
		preprocessor over header files.

Sat Oct 22 13:25:18 1994    (tytso@rsx-11)

	* aclocal.m4 (CopyHeader): Remove header file from include

	* configure.in: Add recursive "make check" target.

Mon Oct  3 22:50:07 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

Fri Sep 30 18:49:41 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* aclocal.m4 (CONFIG_RULES): set SHELL=/bin/sh explicitly, as per

	* .../*.[ch]: remove rcsid, sccsid strings; punt all RCS variable
	expansions; get rid of LIBC_SCCS. Leave the BSD sccs variables in
	comments, for historical reference.

Thu Aug  4 03:11:13 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* aclocal.m4: fixed up Krb5InstallHeaders to use INSTALL_DATA
	properly
	* Makefile.in: fix mkdir breakage for install target

Wed Jul 20 00:00:00 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in (in all relevant subdirs):
	* configure.in (in all relevant subdirs): changes to fix make
	install
	* aclocal.m4: make changes to look for install.sh in the right
	places

	* aclocal.m4: fixing things so we don't have to bother ignoring
	errors.

Fri Jul  1 13:01:19 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* aclocal.m4: added WITH_CC for use when CONFIG_RULES isn't safe.
	added EXTRA_RULES_IN for chosing the file that the extra rules get
	appended to (particularly for lib/krb5/asn.1).
	made CONFIG_RULES use WITH_CC directly.

Fri Jul  1 02:21:51 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* aclocal.m4: fixes for dealing with new version of autoconf, in
	particular quoting and BUILDTOP

Mon Jun 27 08:21:42 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* aclocal.m4: fixes to do sane quoting of arguments before
	recursing.  This allows options to be set with values containing
	whitespace, for instance.

	* configure.in (in all relevant subdirs): move invokations of
	CONFIG_RULES around so that they preceed anything that even
	vaguely resembles a compile test.  This is so that $CC will get
	set properly before any compile tests run.

Sat Jun 25 00:33:56 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in (in all relevant subdirs): make install will dtrt
	now (mostly)
	* configure.in (in all relevant subdirs): ditto

Thu Jun 23 01:13:20 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* aclocal.m4 (CONFIG_RULES): make --with-cc= dtrt and default to
	CC=cc

Wed Jun 22 16:34:46 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin at tweedledumber.cygnus.com)

	* aclocal.m4 (CONFIG_RULES): add AC_SUBST([CC]) so that CC gets
	nailed in correctly.

Tue Jun 21 17:46:53 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (in all subdirs): added CC=@CC@ to nail down the
	substitution to be sure that configuration matches build. Added
	CCOPTS to some of them so that it gets nailed in correctly too.

Tue Jun 21 02:08:27 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in (in all relevant subdirs): added CCOPTS=@CCOPTS@ in
	order to allow for configured default flags
	* configure.in (in all relevant subdirs): add WITH_CCOPTS
	* acloca.m4: define WITH_CCOPTS

Fri Jun 17 19:54:00 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin at cygnus.com)

	* aclocal.m4 (MAKE_SUBDIRS): pass CCOPTS, CC in every make
	* Makefile.in: change CFLAGS = -g ... to CFALGS = $(CCOPTS) ...
	  in all Makefile.in's throughout the tree.

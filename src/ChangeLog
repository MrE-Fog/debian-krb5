Fri Apr 14 21:21:28 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@lurch.mit.edu>

	* aclocal.m4 (_MAKE_SUBDIRS): If there is an error while making in
	        a subdirectory, abort the make in the parent directory.
	        This makes it more obvious when we have a problem in the
	        tree.

Fri Apr 14 08:23:52 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* aclocal.m4 (MAKE_SUBDIRS, _MAKE_SUBDIRS): Creatre new macro
		_MAKE_SUBDIRS which works like MAKE_SUBDIRS except that it
		is possible for the target name in the parent Makefile and
		the target name which should be built in each of the
		subdirectories can be different.  MAKE_SUBDIRS is now a
		special case of _MAKE_SUBDIRS.

Fri Mar 31 21:27:13 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* aclocal.m4: Use the local autoconf when rebuilding the configure

	run through `sed' for the Macintosh.
	* acconfig.h:  Remove STDARG_PROTOTYPES.

		--with-netlib, for support of the SGI's.

Tue Feb 28 00:00:22 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	in the source tree.

Mon Feb 13 23:39:21 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* aclocal.m4 (WITH_LINKER): Add a new configure production which

		running programs like Purify, etc.		

Thu Feb 9 15:42:00 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

Tue Dec 27 06:10:13 1994  Richard Basch  (probe@tardis)

	* aclocal.m4
	combined KRB5_UTPID, KRB5_UTTYPE, and KRB5_UTHOST
	into CHECK_UTMP macro (and added additional checks)


Wed Nov 30 17:13:02 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* aclocal.m4, configure.in: Add appropriate help text for the
		--with-* and --enable-* options.  ISODE_INCLUDES should

Fri Nov 18 15:38:42 1994  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* aclocal.m4 (CHECK_WAIT_TYPE, CHECK_SIGNALS, CHECK_SETJMP,

	AC_TRY_COMPILE instead of AC_TRY_LINK.
	(CHECK_FCNTL): check for 1+O_RDONLY so we aren't fooled into
	declaring it as a local variable.
	(DECLARE_SYS_ERRLIST): same thing for 1+sys_nerr.

Fri Nov 18 00:31:43 1994  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	caching.

		setjmp handling and POSIX signal handling.

Wed Nov  2 20:39:14 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in: We're probably not going to be building in the
		top-level directory, but even so, the CFLAGS should
		include $(DEFS).

		down to subdirectories.

	* aclocal.m4 (CONFIG_RULES, WITH_CPPOPTS): Add support for a new
		"--with-cppopts" value where you can put -DXXXXX such that
		they are found by autoconf tests that use run the

	* configure.in: Add recursive "make check" target.

Mon Oct  3 22:50:07 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	comments, for historical reference.

Thu Aug  4 03:11:13 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* aclocal.m4: fixed up Krb5InstallHeaders to use INSTALL_DATA

	* Makefile.in: fix mkdir breakage for install target

Wed Jul 20 00:00:00 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	install
	* aclocal.m4: make changes to look for install.sh in the right
	places

	errors.

Fri Jul  1 13:01:19 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* aclocal.m4: added WITH_CC for use when CONFIG_RULES isn't safe.
	added EXTRA_RULES_IN for chosing the file that the extra rules get
	appended to (particularly for lib/krb5/asn.1).
	made CONFIG_RULES use WITH_CC directly.

Fri Jul  1 02:21:51 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

Mon Jun 27 08:21:42 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* aclocal.m4: fixes to do sane quoting of arguments before
	recursing.  This allows options to be set with values containing
	whitespace, for instance.

	* configure.in (in all relevant subdirs): move invokations of
	CONFIG_RULES around so that they preceed anything that even
	vaguely resembles a compile test.  This is so that $CC will get
	set properly before any compile tests run.

Sat Jun 25 00:33:56 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in (in all relevant subdirs): make install will dtrt
	now (mostly)
	* configure.in (in all relevant subdirs): ditto

Thu Jun 23 01:13:20 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* aclocal.m4 (CONFIG_RULES): make --with-cc= dtrt and default to

	* Makefile.in (in all subdirs): added CC=@CC@ to nail down the
	substitution to be sure that configuration matches build. Added
	CCOPTS to some of them so that it gets nailed in correctly too.

Tue Jun 21 02:08:27 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in (in all relevant subdirs): added CCOPTS=@CCOPTS@ in
	order to allow for configured default flags
	* configure.in (in all relevant subdirs): add WITH_CCOPTS
	* acloca.m4: define WITH_CCOPTS

Fri Jun 17 19:54:00 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin at cygnus.com)

	* aclocal.m4 (MAKE_SUBDIRS): pass CCOPTS, CC in every make
	* Makefile.in: change CFLAGS = -g ... to CFALGS = $(CCOPTS) ...
	  in all Makefile.in's throughout the tree.

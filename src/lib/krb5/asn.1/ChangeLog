	* asn1_encode_k.h:
	* asn1buf.c:
	* krbasn1.h: punt stdlib.h in favor of stdio.h.  It looks like
	Harry was assuming that NULL gets defined in stdlib instead of
	stdio

	* asn1_encode_k.c (asn1_encode_msgtype): comment out krb5_msgtype
	decl of val arg, use int (to match prototype in header.) Throw out
	OLDDECLARG, DECLARG, and use old-style definition to match style
	of the rest of the code.
	(asn1_encode_ui_4): comment out krb5_ui_4 decl of val arg, use int
	(to match prototype in header.) Also rewrote definition header.

	* asn1_decode.c (asn1_decode_generaltime): tm_gmtoff is *not* in
	System V either. The only portable way to find the delta is to
	subtract gmtime from localtime at a fixed point (epoch+24hours is
	an easy way to simplify the arithmetic.)
	HAVE_GMTOFF: might someday be defined, but for now merely labels
	what the code original did/was intended to do.

	* configure.in: redo "autoconf frobbage" since the old way didn't
	work with srcdir. Now, AC_OUTPUT generates all three Makefiles,
	and ISODEMAKEFILE is subst'ed in to be either Makefile.isode or
	Makefile.sane. EXTRA_RULES_IN is used to append the extra stuff to
	the end of the "real" one of the two.
	* configure.in: krb5_encode.h and krb5_encode.h are source, not
	generated, so use CopySrcHeader instead.

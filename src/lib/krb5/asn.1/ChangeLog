	* krb5_encode.c (encode_krb5_enc_kdc_rep_part): Older versions of
	the Kerberos are always sending the enc_kdc_rep_part structure
	with an application tag of #26, instead of using the application
	tag of #25 (AS REP) or #26 (AS REP) as necessary.  Worse yet, they
	will only accept a tag of #26, so we need to follow this for
	backwards compatibility.  #defining KRB5_ENCKRB5KDCREPPART_COMPAT
	will preserve this wrong (but compatible) behavior.

	* krb5_decode.c (decode_krb5_enc_kdc_rep_part): Record the tag
	value of the ASN.1 sequence in the rkb5_enc_kdc_rep structure.
	Allow both tag #25 and #26 (although old software was always
	sending tag #26).

	* krb5_decode.c (decode_krb5_as_rep, decode_krb5_tgs_rep,
	decode_krb5_ap_req, decode_krb5_ap_rep, decode_krb5_as_req,
	decode_krb5_tgs_req, decode_krb5_safe, decode_krb5_priv,
	decode_krb5_cred, decode_krb5_error): Only check the ASN.1 message
	type if KRB5_MSGTYPE_STRICT is defined.  "Be strict in what you
	send out, liberal in what you receive..."

	* asn1_decode_k.c (asn1_decode_msgtype): Stop checking the
	validity of the message type here.  Each routine that calls
	asn1_decode_msgtype is checking the message type anyway, so it's
	just duplicated effort.

Sat Aug 13 03:40:16 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@perdiem)

	* krbasn1.h: include stdlib.h for calloc declaration (if we can)

Thu Aug 11 00:38:10 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* asn1_encode_k.c (asn1_encode_kdc_req): Add extra argument which
	specifies the msg_type of the encoding; don't use req->msg_type
	which is generally not set right.  (That output is only as a place
	to stash the msg_type from decode).  All callers updated.

	* asn1_encode_k.c (asn1_encode_kdc_rep): Add extra argument which
	specifies the msg_type of the encoding; don't use rep->msg_type
	which is generally not set right.  (That output is only as a place
	to stash the msg_type from decode).  All callers updated.

	* asn1_encode_k.c (asn1_encode_msgtype): Routine removed.  Not
	really necessary, since a msg_type is really just an integer.  


Thu Aug  4 13:19:14 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* asn1_decode_k.c (asn1_decode_sequence_of_enctype): fix typo

Tue Aug  2 07:22:57 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* asn1_decode_k.c (asn1_decode_sequence_of_enctype): more fixing
	of realloc(NULL) returning NULL

Sat Jul 23 08:48:18 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* asn1buf.h: include ext-proto.h now to avoid type warnings

Sat Jul 16 00:19:18 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* asn1_encode_k.c (asn1_encode_transited_encoding): whoops don't
	bomb if val->tr_contents.dlength == 0

	* asn1_decode_k.c (asn1_decode_encrypted_data): oops looks like
	Harry made a brain fart here.... default value for kvno was 5, not
	0.

Thu Jul 14 11:37:59 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso at tsx-11)

	* asn1_*.[ch]: 
	* krb5_*.[ch]: Add MIT Copyright notices.

Thu Jul 14 01:26:22 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* asn1_encode_k.c (asn1_encode_pa_data): oops still check NULL if
	length != 0

Sat Jul  9 00:26:48 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* asn1_encode_k.c (asn1_encode_pa_data): the contents field of a
	krb5_pa_data structure can be NULL (e.g.
	salt_type==KRB5_KDB_SALTTYPE_V4), and the encoder was treating
	this as a missing required field

Fri Jul  8 17:32:29 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* asn1_decode_k.c: yet another instance of the SunOS realloc bug

	* asn1buf.c: whee SunOS realloc of a NULL pointer returns NULL.
	sigh.

Wed Jul  6 13:21:35 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* an1buf.c: Harry saves vs. Unix again.  Making sure that anything
	that can call calloc with a zero argument won't return ENOMEM if
	calloc retuns NULL in this case.  This was prompted by breakage
	under linux.

	* asn1_encode.c (asn1_encode_generaltime): don't use strftime on
	the output of gmtime -- under Solaris, it mutates it! (seems to be
	doing a timezone offset.) Besides, sprintf is quite sufficient.
	Also rename local variable time to gtime to avoid name collision.
	(asn1_decode_generaltime): the fixed-point method below doesn't
	actually work because it doesn't handle the current timezone
	offset. Simpler, and more general -- always call gmt_mktime, which
	is now provided in lib/krb5/os/gmt_mktime.c.

Sun Jul  3 04:43:42 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* asn1_encode_k.h:
	* asn1buf.c:
	* krbasn1.h: punt stdlib.h in favor of stdio.h.  It looks like
	Harry was assuming that NULL gets defined in stdlib instead of
	stdio

Fri Jul  1 13:03:39 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* asn1_encode_k.c (asn1_encode_msgtype): comment out krb5_msgtype
	decl of val arg, use int (to match prototype in header.) Throw out
	OLDDECLARG, DECLARG, and use old-style definition to match style
	of the rest of the code.
	(asn1_encode_ui_4): comment out krb5_ui_4 decl of val arg, use int
	(to match prototype in header.) Also rewrote definition header.

	* asn1_decode.c (asn1_decode_generaltime): tm_gmtoff is *not* in
	System V either. The only portable way to find the delta is to
	subtract gmtime from localtime at a fixed point (epoch+24hours is
	an easy way to simplify the arithmetic.)
	HAVE_GMTOFF: might someday be defined, but for now merely labels
	what the code original did/was intended to do.

	* configure.in: redo "autoconf frobbage" since the old way didn't
	work with srcdir. Now, AC_OUTPUT generates all three Makefiles,
	and ISODEMAKEFILE is subst'ed in to be either Makefile.isode or
	Makefile.sane. EXTRA_RULES_IN is used to append the extra stuff to
	the end of the "real" one of the two.
	* configure.in: krb5_encode.h and krb5_encode.h are source, not
	generated, so use CopySrcHeader instead.

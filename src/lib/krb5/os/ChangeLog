Fri Mar 17 19:56:39 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* Makefile.in (LDFLAGS):  Eliminate, duplicates config/pre.in.
	* localaddr.c:  Remove socket include files now handled in k5-int.h.

Wed Mar 15 12:19:47 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* sendto_kdc.c: made to work on the PC.

Tue Mar  7 22:15:00 1995 Keith Vetter <keithv@fusion.com>

	* sendto_kdc.c: stubbed on the PC for now.

Tue Mar  7 19:54:17 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: take out ISODE_DEFS, ISODE_INCLUDE.

Tue Mar 7 13:35:21 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* *.c: ported all the c files except an_to_ln, kuserok, and
          sendto_kdc which have windows stubs.
        * Makefile.in: reflects above changes.

Wed Mar 1 17:30:00 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: made to work on the PC
	* ustime.c: added section for time on the PC
	* localaddr.c: added section for the PC--returns local IP address
	N.B. not sure how we're going to handle different machine dependent
	code changes. For now it's just added to the end of the file. Later,
	we have to decide on a solution for all.

Tue Feb 28 01:07:37 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* *.c:  Avoid <krb5/...> includes.

Fri Feb  3 08:24:18 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* gmt_mktime.c (gmt_mktime): Don't double count the leap day in a
		leap year.

Sun Jan 22 18:23:37 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* get_krbhst.c (krb5_get_krbhst):  Declare realm argument const,
	to match prototype.

Wed Jan 18 11:08:59 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* sendto_kdc.c (krb5_sendto_kdc): Fix use of connected sockets;
		previously krb5_sendto_kdc only used one socket per
		address family.  This doesn't work; it now uses one
		socket per address. (krb5-bugs #938)

Fri Jan 13 15:23:47 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

	* Actually move the file init_ctx.c to init_os_ctx.c in the CVS
		repository and also rename the routine  krb5_free_os_context()
		to krb5_os_free_context().

Fri Jan 13 15:23:47 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

    * Added krb5_context to all krb5_routines

	* Moved init_ctx.c to init_os_ctx.c because a library cannot
		have more than on file with the same name. See krb/init_ctx.c

Mon Dec 19 15:20:35 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* init_ctx.c: New file.  Initializes and frees the krb5_os_context
	  structure. 

	* realm_dom.c (krb5_get_realm_domain): Fixed minor bug where the
		length of the returned domain was calculated incorrectly.

Mon Oct 31 17:04:08 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* lock_file.c: Back out POSIX_FILE_LOCKS change.  (Should be
		depending on autoconf.h to supply this #define if
		necessary.) 

Thu Oct 13 17:24:31 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@maytag)

	* configure.in: Add ISODE_DEFS

Fri Oct  7 13:23:18 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* configure.in: Add test for unistd.h

	* lock_file.c: Use POSIX_FILE_LOCKS if _POSIX_VERSION is defined
		in unistd.h

Thu Sep 22 20:46:08 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* configure.in: Put in correct dependency order of configure.in
		lines.

Wed Jul  6 13:26:59 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* gmt_mktime.c (gmt_mktime): New file, new function. Similar to
	POSIX mktime, but always works in GMT.
	configure.in, Makefile.in: build gmt_mktime.

Wed Jun 22 15:49:30 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso at tsx-11)

	* locate_kdc.c (krb5_locate_kdc): Fixed default port numbers so
	they are loaded in network byte order instead of host byte order.

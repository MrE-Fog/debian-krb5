Fri May 26 20:19:26 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: Add support for building shared libraries.

Thu Apr 13 15:49:16 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* ccbase.c: removed unneeded INTERFACE from non-api functions.

Wed Mar 22 11:47:49 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS): Make -I options work when the build and
		source tree are different.

Fri Mar 17 19:19:07 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* Makefile.in (LDFLAGS):  Remove, duplicates config/pre.in.
	(CFLAGS):  Add -I options for file and stdio, to avoid paths in
	#include statements.
	(all-mac, clean-mac):  Add.
	* ccdefops.c:  Avoid includes with pathnames, since they don't work
	on the Mac.  Configure the default cache based on whether the
	system has <sys/types.h> (which defines types for low-level file
	operations, among other things).
	* configure.in (CONFIG_DIRS):  Build stdio before file, for Mac
	convenience (where file doesn't build).

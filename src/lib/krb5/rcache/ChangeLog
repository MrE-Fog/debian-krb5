	* rc_dfl.c (krb5_rc_dfl_recover): krb5_rc_io_size was being called
		with the wrong type argument.  I have no idea how it was

	* rc_io.c: The variables dirlen and dir were declared global, and
		didn't need to be; changed to be static.

	* rc_dfl.c (krb5_rc_dfl_expunge): name (t->name) was getting freed
	and we tried to use it.  Clear t->name to stop it from being
	freed, and then free it later.

	* rc_base.h: #include <krb5/osconf.h> so that build works using	imake.

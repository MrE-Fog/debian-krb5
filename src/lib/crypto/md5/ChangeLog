	(check):  Use $(EXEEXT).

Tue Mar 14 17:24:57 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* md5crypto.c: removed method for DLL data since everything's
           going into one DLL.

Fri Mar 3 19:01:59 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* md5crypto.c: added a method to pull in a data structure 
           from outside a dll.

Thu Mar 2 17:54:26 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: changed LIBNAME for the PC

Tue Feb 28 00:20:15 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* md5.c, md5crypto.c, md5glue.c, t_mddriver.c:  Avoid <krb5/...>
	includes.

Mon Feb 20 15:54:1 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: made to work for the PC
        * md5.c, md5crypt.c md5glue.c: added windows INTERFACE keyword

Thu Feb  2 03:01:28 1995  John Gilmore  <gnu@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS):  Handle $(srcdir) properly in -I options.

Wed Jan 25 20:11:30 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS):  Use -I../des to pull in include file.
	* md5.c, md5crypto.c, md5glue.c, t_mddriver.c:  Replace <.../...>
	includes with "..."s.

Fri Oct 14 00:22:19 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* t_mddriver.c (MDString, MDTestSuite): Cast char pointer to the
		expected unsigned char pointer, since that's what MDUpdate
		requires. 

Thu Oct 13 17:50:19 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in: Add support for the MDx test driver t_mddriver.
		Run t_mddriver on a "make check", to make sure we have a
		valid MD5 implementation.

	* md5.c (UL): Add the UL macro to control how unsigned long
		constants are compiled.  If we have an ANSI C environment,
		use the UL suffix to keep the compiler from warning about
		numbers that would overflow a signed long.

Tue Oct  4 14:55:10 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* md5crypto.c:
	* md5glue.c: Added placeholder for magic number.

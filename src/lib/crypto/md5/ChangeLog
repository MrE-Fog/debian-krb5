	* md5.c, md5crypto.c, md5glue.c, t_mddriver.c:  Avoid <krb5/...>
	includes.

Mon Feb 20 15:54:1 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: made to work for the PC
        * md5.c, md5crypt.c md5glue.c: added windows INTERFACE keyword

	* t_mddriver.c (MDString, MDTestSuite): Cast char pointer to the
		expected unsigned char pointer, since that's what MDUpdate
		requires. 

Thu Oct 13 17:50:19 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in: Add support for the MDx test driver t_mddriver.
		Run t_mddriver on a "make check", to make sure we have a
		valid MD5 implementation.

	* md5.c (UL): Add the UL macro to control how unsigned long
		constants are compiled.  If we have an ANSI C environment,
		use the UL suffix to keep the compiler from warning about
		numbers that would overflow a signed long.

	* md5crypto.c:
	* md5glue.c: Added placeholder for magic number.

Wed Jan 25 20:08:47 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS):  Add -I../des to pull in DES header file.
	* 
rsa-md4.h:  New include file, moved from include/krb5, since
	it's only used locally.

Thu Oct 13 17:48:21 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in: Add support for the MDx test driver t_mddriver.
		Run t_mddriver on a "make check", to make sure we have a
		valid MD4 implementation.

	* md4.c (UL): Add the UL macro to control how unsigned long
		constants are compiled.  If we have an ANSI C environment,
		use the UL suffix to keep the compiler from warning about
		numbers that would overflow a signed long.

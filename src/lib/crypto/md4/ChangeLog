	* md4crypto.c: removed method for DLL data since everything's
           going into one DLL.

Mon Feb 20 15:54:1 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: made to work for the PC
        * md4.c, md4crypt.c md4glue.c: added windows INTERFACE keyword
        * rsa-md4.h: added windows INTERFACE to prototypes

Wed Jan 25 20:08:47 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS):  Add -I../des to pull in DES header file.
	* 
rsa-md4.h:  New include file, moved from include/krb5, since
	it's only used locally.
	* md4.c, md4crypto.c, md4driver.c, md4glue.c:  Replace <.../...>

Thu Oct 13 17:48:21 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in: Add support for the MDx test driver t_mddriver.
		Run t_mddriver on a "make check", to make sure we have a
		valid MD4 implementation.

	* md4.c (UL): Add the UL macro to control how unsigned long
		constants are compiled.  If we have an ANSI C environment,
		use the UL suffix to keep the compiler from warning about
		numbers that would overflow a signed long.

	* md4crypto.c:
	* md4glue.c: Added placeholder for magic number.

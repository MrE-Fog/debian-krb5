	* Makefile.in: Add support for the MDx test driver t_mddriver.
		Run t_mddriver on a "make check", to make sure we have a
		valid MD4 implementation.

	* md4.c (UL): Add the UL macro to control how unsigned long
		constants are compiled.  If we have an ANSI C environment,
		use the UL suffix to keep the compiler from warning about
		numbers that would overflow a signed long.

	* md4glue.c: Added placeholder for magic number.

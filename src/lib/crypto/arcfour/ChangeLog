	* string_to_key.c (krb5_arcfour_string_to_key): Ignore salt
	(krb5_arcfour_string_to_key): Use memset not bzero

	* arcfour.c (krb5_arcfour_decrypt): Return error if salt cannot be allocated
	(krb5_arcfour_encrypt): Only memset bits of key to known value on export-grade crypto

	* arcfour.c (arcfour_translate_usage): Attempt to implement based
	on draft-brezak-win2k-krb-rc4-hmac-03.  Several usages remain unclear.
	Make 40-bit string not unsigned to avoid warning
	(krb5_arcfour_encrypt krb5_arcfour_decrypt):  cast to avoid pointer warnings

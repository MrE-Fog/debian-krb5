	* verify.c (main): Take out check that assures that long is 4
		bytes.  The DES implementation shouldn't be depending on
		this, and if it is, then that's what the verify program
		should be discovering, yes?

	* cs_entry.c: oops typo in that last one

	* grrr.... ETYPE_DES_CBC_CRC really should be ETYPE_RAW_DES_CBC,
	although something like ETYPE_DES_CBC_RAW or ETYPE_DES_CBC_NONE
	would probably work better (following the convention
	ETYPE_{system}_{mode}_{integrity})

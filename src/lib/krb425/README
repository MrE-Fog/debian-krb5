This library exports the Kerberos V4 API, acts as a glue layer to the
Kerberos V5 library.  However convenient this sounds, in general
practice the use of this library is not recommened, and its use is not
supported.  In fact, it hasn't even been updated to the new V4 API
changes yet.

The reason for this is that while it represents a simple and easy way
to convert an application program which was written to the Kerberos V4
API to use the Kerberos V5 protocol, the way which the Kerberos V5 protocol
is used is not guaranteed to be standardized in any way.

Application programmers are urged to take the time to recode their
applications to call either the Kerberos V5 library directly or better
yet to use the GSSAPI library.  Changes to the application protocol
may be necessary in either case, but the end result will be much
cleaner and in all likelihood much more interoperable.

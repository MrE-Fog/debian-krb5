Mon Mar 20 21:14:40 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in, unix_time.c(unix_time_gmt_unixsec): Added function
		needed for des425 to work with the Cygnus krb.a.

Wed Mar 15 13:44:23 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* des.h: now includes des_int.h for proper prototypes.
	* enc_dec.c: cast the types of the input/output buffers in calling
           the encrypt routine.
	* key_sched.c: removed prototype of a non-existent routine.
	* new_rnd_key.c: removed prototypes in the file and instead include
           header file with the real prototypes.
	* random_key.c: code, as it was, could never have worked. Adding 
           prototypes revealed that it was passing KEY with the wrong level
           of indirection.

	* cksum.c, des.c, des.h, enc_dec.c, pcbc_encrypt.c, quad_cksum.c,
	read_passwd.c, string2key.c, weak_key.c:  Avoid <krb5/...> includes.

Tue Feb 21 17:42:44 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

        * Makefile.in: made to work on the PC
	* *.c, des.h: added windows INTERFACE keyword
        * read_passwd.c: renamed a static variable to avoid compiler error
        * quad_cksum.c: errno extern declaration removed on the PC

    * Added krb5_context to all krb5_routines

Thu Nov  3 18:29:10 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* pcbc_encrypt.c: moved from f_pcbc.c in lib/crypto/des, and
	inlined proper des.h to avoid confusion in names.

	lib/crypto/des as well.

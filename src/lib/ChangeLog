Wed Apr 27 11:00:00 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* configure.in: add krb4 directory (still needs to be
	conditionalized on unix)

Thu Apr 20 12:16:50 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* win_glue.c: include k5-int.h instead of krb5.h.

Mon Apr 17 17:47:07 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: forgot about the rule to make gssapi.lib on the PC.

Wed Apr 12 14:40:30 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: Move dependency for all-$WHAT back
		into Makefile.in so that the Windows port can pick up the
		line (since it doesn't use configure).  Instead, change
		the name of target which causes the subdirectories to be
		built under Unix, and make that a dependency for all-unix.
		Gross, but this should fix things for both DOS and Windows.

Thu Apr 13 16:56:50 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in, libkrb5.def, gssapi.def (new):

		all" subdirectories rule.

Thu Mar 30 15:46:23 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* libkrb5.def: removed the masses of exported files, leaving just
	   the ones needed by telnet and cns plus the gssapi ones.

Tue Mar 28 18:26:01 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* Makefile.in (clean-mac):  Add.
	* configure.in (LinkFile's):  Put `./' on libraries to ease Mac

Mon Oct  3 23:38:03 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

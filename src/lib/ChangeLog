Thu Apr 27 11:54:19 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: add krb4 directory (still needs to be
	conditionalized on unix)

Thu Apr 20 12:16:50 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* win_glue.c: include k5-int.h instead of krb5.h.

Mon Apr 17 17:47:07 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: forgot about the rule to make gssapi.lib on the PC.

Wed Apr 12 14:40:30 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: Move dependency for all-$WHAT back
		into Makefile.in so that the Windows port can pick up the
		line (since it doesn't use configure).  Instead, change
		the name of target which causes the subdirectories to be
		built under Unix, and make that a dependency for all-unix.
		Gross, but this should fix things for both DOS and Windows.

Thu Apr 13 16:56:50 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in, libkrb5.def, gssapi.def (new): 
           Spec says we need a gssapi.dll & gssapi.lib.
        * Makefile.in: re-inserted make-$(ALL) rule.

Wed Apr 5 16:27:53 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* libkrb5.def: added krb5_us_timeofday to export list

Fri Mar 31 16:15:59 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: Move the dependency which causes
		all-$(WHAT) to be built so that it occurs after the "make
		all" subdirectories rule.

Thu Mar 30 15:46:23 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* libkrb5.def: removed the masses of exported files, leaving just
	   the ones needed by telnet and cns plus the gssapi ones.

Tue Mar 28 18:26:01 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* Makefile.in (clean-mac):  Add.
	* configure.in (LinkFile's):  Put `./' on libraries to ease Mac
	translation.
	(AppendRule all-unix):  Rename from AppendRule all.

Thu Mar 23 14:26:35 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: also produces a map for the dll.

Tue Mar 21 18:59:15 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: added xxx-MAC targets for macintosh compatibility,
	   and added gssapi to libkrb5 dll.
	* libkrb5.def: added gssapi routines to the export section.

Thu Mar 16 15:00:00 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: fixed up a typo.

Wed Mar 15 22:45:33 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: I had missed some dependencies on the PC build.

Wed Mar 15 20:45:33 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* libkrb5.def, winsock.def, win_glue.c: new files for making DLL.
        * Makefile.in: On the PC it recurses into all subdirs and builds
           libkrb5.dll.

Tue Feb 28 01:33:52 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* glue4.c:  Avoid <krb5/...> includes.

Thu Oct  6 20:06:06 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* configure.in: Add recursive "make check" target.

Mon Oct  3 23:38:03 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* configure.in: Don't build the krb425 library.  It is deprecated.

Fri Sep 30 16:35:16 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in: Also delete libkdb5.a on make clean.

Thu Aug  4 03:39:23 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in: make install fixes

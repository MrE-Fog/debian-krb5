Sat Feb 24 16:19:30 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* g_mechname.c (gss_add_mech_name_type): Only mark a name-type as
		being non-mechanism-specific if the mechanism doesn't
		match the type currently associated with the name-type.

	* g_init_sec_context.c (gss_init_security_context): If we are
		using a mechanism-specific name, use the
		mechanism-specific name directly, instead of calling
		__gss_internal_import() on the external form of the name.
		If the mechanism_type is unspecified, use the type of the
		mechanism-specific name.  If the mechanism_type is
		specified, it must match the type of the supplied name.

	* g_acquire_cred.c (gss_acquire_cred): If we are acquiring
		credentials for a mechanism-specific name, use the name
		directly, instead of doing an __gss_internal_import() on
		the name.  Also, if the desired_mechanisms oid is NULL,
		default to using the mechanism-type of the
		mechanism-specific name.

	* g_compare_name.c (gss_compare_name): Add logic for comparing
		mechanism-specific names.

	* g_accept_sec_context.c (gss_accept_sec_context): Use
		__gss_convert_name_to_union_name() to take the gss_name_t
		returned by the mechanism accept_sec_context(), and
		convert it into a mechanism-specific union name.

	* g_inquire_context.c (gss_inquire_context):  Removed local static
		function convert_name_to_union_name(), and changed
		references to it use the generalized
		__gss_convert_name_to_union_name() call.

	* g_glue.c (__gss_convert_name_to_union_name): New function which
		takes gss_name_t returned by a particular mechanism, and
		converts it into a gss_union_name.

	* g_rel_oid_set.c (gss_release_oid_set): Manually free the oids in
		an OID set, since the containing structure is allocated as
		an array.

Sat Feb 24 12:21:03 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* mglueP.h (gss_config): Change int fields to OM_uint32 to match
		arguments to procedure calls in gss_init_sec_context,
		gss_accept_sec_context, and gss_display_status.

Sat Feb 24 00:00:27 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* g_imp_name.c (gss_import_name): If the user passes in a
		name-type which is mechanism specific, then import it
		immediately; don't lazy evaluate it.

	* g_mechname.c (gss_add_mech_name_type): New file for maintaining
		a registry of name-types which are mechanism specific.

	* g_dsp_name.c (gss_display_name): If there is a mechanism
		specific name, use it when displaying the name.

	* oid_ops.c (generic_gss_copy_oid): New function used to copy an
		OID object.

Fri Feb 23 18:27:20 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* g_rel_name.c (gss_release_name): Release the OID in the
		mechanism name, as it is now allocated.  Release the
		mechanism-specific name if it is present.

	* g_imp_name.c (gss_import_name):  Copy the input OID, so we don't
		have to worry about memory allocation problems later.
		Initialize mech_type and mech_name in the union name to be
		zero.  (for now)

	* oid_ops.c (generic_gss_copy_oid): Added new function to copy OIDs.

Thu Feb 22 21:48:44 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* mglueP.h: Add space for the mechanism name in gss_union_name.

Sat Feb 10 18:38:43 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@dragons-lair.MIT.EDU>

	* g_glue.c: grab stdlib.h to get NULL

Fri Feb  9 09:04:50 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* g_inquire_context.c: Include stdlib.h if present

Wed Feb  7 14:16:01 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* g_initialize.c: Need to include stdio.h, errno.h all the time.

Tue Feb  6 23:59:49 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* g_initialize.c (gss_initialize): Added code to try to
		dynamically read in the GSSAPI mechanim library using
		dlopen().

Wed Jan 24 20:49:13 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@dragons-lair.MIT.EDU>

	* g_compare_name.c, g_delete_sec_context.c, g_dsp_status.c,
	g_exp_sec_context.c, g_imp_sec_context.c, g_rel_buffer.c,
	g_rel_cred.c, g_rel_name.c, g_rel_oid_set.c, get_mechanism.c,
	get_mtype.c: Include stdlib.h and string.h as needed

	* mglueP.h: Add many invocations of NPROTOTYPE and PROTOTYPE to
		prevent breakage.

Tue Jan 23 11:52:24 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* add_mechanism.c, g_inquire_cred.c, g_imp_name.c,
	  g_dsp_name.c, g_indicate_mechs.c, g_accept_sec_context.c,
	  g_init_sec_context.c, g_acquire_cred.c: Include stdlib.h, string.h

	* configure.in: Check for stdlib.h

	* Makefile.in (SRCS): Remove extraneous line with only a tab.
		(SHLIB_LDFLAGS): Declare that krb5_gss_initialize is to be
		unresolved.

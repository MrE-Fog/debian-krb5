	* g_imp_name.c (gss_import_name): If the user passes in a
		name-type which is mechanism specific, then import it
		immediately; don't lazy evaluate it.

	* g_mechname.c (gss_add_mech_name_type): New file for maintaining
		a registry of name-types which are mechanism specific.

	* g_dsp_name.c (gss_display_name): If there is a mechanism
		specific name, use it when displaying the name.

	* oid_ops.c (generic_gss_copy_oid): New function used to copy an
		OID object.

Fri Feb 23 18:27:20 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* g_rel_name.c (gss_release_name): Release the OID in the
		mechanism name, as it is now allocated.  Release the
		mechanism-specific name if it is present.

	* g_imp_name.c (gss_import_name):  Copy the input OID, so we don't
		have to worry about memory allocation problems later.
		Initialize mech_type and mech_name in the union name to be
		zero.  (for now)

	* oid_ops.c (generic_gss_copy_oid): Added new function to copy OIDs.

	* g_initialize.c (gss_initialize): Added code to try to

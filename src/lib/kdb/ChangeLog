	* kdb_dbm.c (decode_princ_contents): Add backwards compatibility
		for version numbers 1.0 and 2.0.

	* kdb_dbm.c (decode_princ_contents): Force an incompatible version
		number change to the database --- we are now at database
		entry version 2.0.  Unfortunately, the way we encode the
		database is completely broken, and any structure changes
		change the encoding format.  We will need to redo this
		completely at some point, so we don't have to make people
		go through this again.

	* Makefile.in: make install obey $(DESTDIR)

Thu Aug  4 03:41:44 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* configure.in: look for install program

	* Makefile.in: make install fixes

Fri Jul 15 14:54:10 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso at tsx-11)

	* kdb_dbm.c (krb5_dbm_db_end_update): Change use of utimes() to
	the POSIX utime() function.

	* Makefile.in: make install obey $(DESTDIR) completely

	* kdb_dbm.c (decode_princ_contents): Force an incompatible version
		number change to the database --- we are now at database
		entry version 2.0.  Unfortunately, the way we encode the
		database is completely broken, and any structure changes
		change the encoding format.  We will need to redo this
		completely at some point, so we don't have to make people
		go through this again.

	* Makefile.in: make install obey $(DESTDIR)

	the POSIX utime() function.

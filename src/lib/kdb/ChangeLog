Fri Mar 24 21:59:34 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* store_mkey.c (krb5_db_store_mkey): 
	* fetch_mkey.c (krb5_db_fetch_mkey): Hardcode the size of the
		keytype field in the file format, to be compatible with
		what was used in the Beta 4 release (before we changed the
		size of a krb5_keytype type).

Fri Mar 24 15:13:53 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* kdb_dbm.c: Don't cast dbm_close() to void, because dbm_close is
		already void.

Tue Feb 28 00:30:10 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* decrypt_key.c, encrypt_key.c, fetch_mkey.c, kdb_dbm.c,
	setup_mkey.c, store-mkey.c, verify_mky.c:  Avoid <krb5/...> includes.

Fri Jan 13 15:23:47 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

    * Added krb5_context to all krb5_routines

Thu Nov 17 19:22:16 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* kdb_dbm.c (krb5_dbm_db_unlock): Use krb5_lock_file.
	(krb5_dbm_db_lock): Same. (Changes from jtkohl@mit.edu.)

Thu Nov 10 17:20:42 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* decrypt_key.c (krb5_kdb_decrypt_key): Set the keyblock's magic
		number and ecryption type information appropriately.

Tue Nov  8 18:03:23 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* fetch_mkey.c (krb5_db_fetch_mkey): Set the keyblock's magic
		number and encryption type information appropriately.

Sat Oct 22 10:13:25 1994    (tytso@rsx-11)

	* kdb_dbm.c: Don't need to define POSIX_FILE_LOCKS; just include
		config.h instead.

Wed Oct 19 12:15:36 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in: make install obey $(DESTDIR) completely

Fri Oct 14 00:57:33 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* configure.in: Add test for unistd.h

	* lock_file.c: Use POSIX_FILE_LOCKS if _POSIX_VERSION is defined
		in unistd.h

Tue Oct  4 15:08:03 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* kdb_dbm.c (decode_princ_contents): Add backwards compatibility
		for version numbers 1.0 and 2.0.  

Mon Oct  3 22:47:49 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* kdb_dbm.c (decode_princ_contents): Force an incompatible version
		number change to the database --- we are now at database
		entry version 2.0.  Unfortunately, the way we encode the
		database is completely broken, and any structure changes
		change the encoding format.  We will need to redo this
		completely at some point, so we don't have to make people
		go through this again.

	* Makefile.in: make install obey $(DESTDIR)

Thu Aug  4 03:41:44 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* configure.in: look for install program

	* Makefile.in: make install fixes

Fri Jul 15 14:54:10 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso at tsx-11)

	* kdb_dbm.c (krb5_dbm_db_end_update): Change use of utimes() to
	the POSIX utime() function.

Thu Jun  8 23:32:28 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in: $($(WHAT)_OBJS) is not accepted by all Makes!  We
		assume for now that libkadm.a rule is only used by Unix,
		which should be a valid assumption, and build handle
		$(UNIX_OBJS) there.

Thu Jun 8 14:32:33 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* logger.c - New module to provide profile-controlled logging.  This
		can optionally take over control of com_err(3) output to also
		direct this output to where the profile specifies.  Also
		includes a syslog(3) compatible interface which also follows
		the profile's direction.
	* Makefile.in, configure.in - update for logger.c


Mon Jun 5 14:15:37 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* adm_conn.c - Rework kadm_get_ccache() and kadm_get_creds() so that
		we can specify differing credentials caches and the lifetime
		of obtained tickets if not using an existing ccache.  This
		changes the calling sequence of krb5_adm_connect(), adding
		two arguments: a ccache name and a (delta) lifetime.  Default
		ccache name changes formats to tkt_kadm_<pid> and default
		lifetime is 10 minutes.

	* adm_conn.c: used SOCKET_ERRNO instead of errno and 
	   added prototypes for the local functions.
	* adm_rw.c: added prototypes for the local functions so that
	   ints get promoted to longs correctly on the PC.

Wed May 31 08:10:13 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (DB_OBJS): Change DBOBJS to DB_OBJS to match rest of
		Makefile.in 

Tue May 30 17:36:47 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* adm_rw.c: removed INTERFACE from two routines.

Tue May 30 10:35:07 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* adm_conn.c: used Windows specific way of creating a temp file.
	* Makefile.in: PC doesn't need to compile adm_kw_*.c files.

Thu May 25 17:49:06 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	First pass to make the code compile cleanly on the PC.
	* Makefile.in: made to work on the PC.
	* adm_conn.c: used atoi instead of sscanf since it can't be
	   used in a windows DLL. Why not? Ask Microsoft.
	* adm_kt_e.c, adm_kw_e.c, adm_rw.c: made the explicit the
	   cast to a char when pulling out bytes from an int.
	* adm_kw_d.c: size_t != off_t on the PC. Fixed the equation.
	* adm_rw.c: two parameters were declared as int but prototyped
	   as krb5_int32.

Tue May 16 13:58:30 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* configure.in	- Check for srand48, srand and srandom along with
			  network libraries.
	* t_ktentry.c, t_dbentry.c - Use available random number generator
			  and also make sure memory is freed so we don't
			  chew up memory in tester.


Tue May 16 13:19:04 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* t_dbentry.c	- Change isset to is_a_set to keep Ultrix happy.  Also
			  correctly calculate the length of the standard pwd.
			  so that we don't overwrite the end of the malloc()ed
			  string.
	* t_ktentry.c	- Remove isset logic, no differentiation for keytabs.


Tue May 16 10:35:54 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* t_dbentry.c, t_ktentry.c - new test modules for encode/decode
		functions.  These convert to and from krb5_db_entry and
		krb5_keytab_entry and verify contents.
	* adm_kt_enc.c	- Fix bug encoding integer values.


Tue May 9 15:21:49 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* adm_conn.c	- use profile information to locate the admin_server.
			  Also, return the correct value from krb5_adm_connect
			  instead of always returning zero.
	* adm_{kw,kt}_{enc,dec}.c - New modules to [en/de]code administrative
			  protocol keyword=value pairs and keytab entries.


Fri Apr 28 09:47:29 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)

	Create a new library consisting of functions which communicate with
	the administrative server here.  These modules replace the originals
	which used to be in libkrb5.

	adm_rw.c	- Remove ntohl/htonl in favor of byte blasting.

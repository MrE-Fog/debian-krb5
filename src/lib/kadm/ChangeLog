Tue Aug 8 17:35:10 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* str_conv.c - Fix Purify complaint.


Mon Aug 7 17:38:45 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* keysalt.c(krb5_string_to_keysalt) - Don't do the silly whitespace
		filling logic.  If the string has imbedded whitespace, then
		it's just tough rocks.  Save replaced string separators and
		terminators so that they string looks the same coming out as
		going in.


Fri Aug 4 16:21:50 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in, .Sanitize, keysalt.c - Add keysalt.c modules.


Thu Aug 3 11:51:14 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* alt_prof.c - Actually pass back the parsed string value in krb5_aprof_
		get_deltat().


Mon Jul 31 15:52:40 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* adm_kw_{enc,dec}.c - Add support for new kadmin protocol.
	* alt_prof.c - Remove string conversion routine, use the ones in str_
		conv.c.  Convert krb5_read_realm_params() to use these string
		conversion routines so that the KDC profile is more textual
		as opposed to being numeric.
	* str_conv.c - String conversion routines.
	* Makefile.in, configure.in - Add support for str_conv.c
	* t_dbentry.c - Test new kadmin protocol.

Mon Jul 17 15:16:26 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* alt_prof.c - Add krb5_{read,free}_realm_params() to read in per-
		realm KDC data and to free the allocated structure.

Mon Jul 10 17:59:23 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* adm_kt_dec.c, adm_kt_enc.c, adm_kw_dec.c, adm_kw_enc.c,
		alt_prof.c, logger.c: Include adm_proto.h for prototypes.

Fri Jul 7 16:23:57 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in - Remove LDFLAGS, it's set by configure.  Find com_err
		library in TOPLIBD now.

Thu Jul  6 17:34:22 1995  Tom Yu  <tlyu@lothlorien.MIT.EDU>

	* adm_conn.c (kadm_get_creds): Pass kcontext to os_localaddr.

Tue Jun 27 15:50:31 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* alt_prof.c - Change filename and hierarchy lists to be const char.


Thu Jun 22 11:56:15 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* alt_prof.c - New jacket routines for handling profiles.  This includes
		the ability to parse certain string values to appropriate types
		(e.g. delta time or 32-bit integer).
	* Makefile.in - Add alt_prof.c


Thu Jun 15 18:03:40 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in - Remove explicit copying of archive library to library
		directory.
	* configure.in - Create symlink for archive when we build it.

Wed Jun 14 14:36:13 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tardis.MIT.EDU>

	* t_dbentry.c (main): option should be an int so that comparisons
        against EOF work when char unsigned.

Tue Jun 13 14:37:25 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tardis.MIT.EDU>

	* logger.c: Don't check to make sure unix is defined for
        DEVICE_OPEN et al.  Currently, there are no special cases where
        special handling is required; if they are, then they should be
        checked for, and the generic case taken if no special case fits.
        The previous behavior broke under AIX.


Sun Jun 11 09:24:06 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (clean-unix): Remove $(UNIX_OBJS)

Sat Jun 10 23:05:23 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* adm_conn.c, adm_rw.c: krb5_auth_context redefinitions

Fri Jun  9 19:26:44 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Remove standardized set of autoconf macros, which
		are now handled by CONFIG_RULES.

Thu Jun  8 23:32:28 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in: $($(WHAT)_OBJS) is not accepted by all Makes!  We
		assume for now that libkadm.a rule is only used by Unix,
		which should be a valid assumption, and build handle
		$(UNIX_OBJS) there.

Thu Jun 8 14:32:33 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* logger.c - New module to provide profile-controlled logging.  This
		can optionally take over control of com_err(3) output to also
		direct this output to where the profile specifies.  Also
		includes a syslog(3) compatible interface which also follows
		the profile's direction.
	* Makefile.in, configure.in - update for logger.c


Mon Jun 5 14:15:37 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* adm_conn.c - Rework kadm_get_ccache() and kadm_get_creds() so that
		we can specify differing credentials caches and the lifetime
		of obtained tickets if not using an existing ccache.  This
		changes the calling sequence of krb5_adm_connect(), adding
		two arguments: a ccache name and a (delta) lifetime.  Default
		ccache name changes formats to tkt_kadm_<pid> and default
		lifetime is 10 minutes.

Fri Jun 2 17:56:03 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* adm_conn.c: used SOCKET_ERRNO instead of errno and 
	   added prototypes for the local functions.
	* adm_rw.c: added prototypes for the local functions so that
	   ints get promoted to longs correctly on the PC.

Wed May 31 08:10:13 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (DB_OBJS): Change DBOBJS to DB_OBJS to match rest of
		Makefile.in 

Tue May 30 17:36:47 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* adm_rw.c: removed INTERFACE from two routines.

Tue May 30 10:35:07 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* adm_conn.c: used Windows specific way of creating a temp file.
	* Makefile.in: PC doesn't need to compile adm_kw_*.c files.

Thu May 25 17:49:06 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	First pass to make the code compile cleanly on the PC.
	* Makefile.in: made to work on the PC.
	* adm_conn.c: used atoi instead of sscanf since it can't be
	   used in a windows DLL. Why not? Ask Microsoft.
	* adm_kt_e.c, adm_kw_e.c, adm_rw.c: made the explicit the
	   cast to a char when pulling out bytes from an int.
	* adm_kw_d.c: size_t != off_t on the PC. Fixed the equation.
	* adm_rw.c: two parameters were declared as int but prototyped
	   as krb5_int32.

Tue May 16 13:58:30 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* configure.in	- Check for srand48, srand and srandom along with
			  network libraries.
	* t_ktentry.c, t_dbentry.c - Use available random number generator
			  and also make sure memory is freed so we don't
			  chew up memory in tester.


Tue May 16 13:19:04 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* t_dbentry.c	- Change isset to is_a_set to keep Ultrix happy.  Also
			  correctly calculate the length of the standard pwd.
			  so that we don't overwrite the end of the malloc()ed
			  string.
	* t_ktentry.c	- Remove isset logic, no differentiation for keytabs.


Tue May 16 10:35:54 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* t_dbentry.c, t_ktentry.c - new test modules for encode/decode
		functions.  These convert to and from krb5_db_entry and
		krb5_keytab_entry and verify contents.
	* adm_kt_enc.c	- Fix bug encoding integer values.


Tue May 9 15:21:49 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* adm_conn.c	- use profile information to locate the admin_server.
			  Also, return the correct value from krb5_adm_connect
			  instead of always returning zero.
	* adm_{kw,kt}_{enc,dec}.c - New modules to [en/de]code administrative
			  protocol keyword=value pairs and keytab entries.


Fri Apr 28 09:47:29 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)

	Create a new library consisting of functions which communicate with
	the administrative server here.  These modules replace the originals
	which used to be in libkrb5.

	adm_rw.c	- Remove ntohl/htonl in favor of byte blasting.

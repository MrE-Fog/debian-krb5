	* adm_conn.c: used Windows specific way of creating a temp file.
	* Makefile.in: PC doesn't need to compile adm_kw_*.c files.

	First pass to make the code compile cleanly on the PC.
	* Makefile.in: made to work on the PC.
	* adm_conn.c: used atoi instead of sscanf since it can't be
	   used in a windows DLL. Why not? Ask Microsoft.
	* adm_kt_e.c, adm_kw_e.c, adm_rw.c: made the explicit the
	   cast to a char when pulling out bytes from an int.
	* adm_kw_d.c: size_t != off_t on the PC. Fixed the equation.
	* adm_rw.c: two parameters were declared as int but prototyped
	   as krb5_int32.

	* configure.in	- Check for srand48, srand and srandom along with
			  network libraries.
	* t_ktentry.c, t_dbentry.c - Use available random number generator
			  and also make sure memory is freed so we don't
			  chew up memory in tester.


Tue May 16 13:19:04 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* t_dbentry.c	- Change isset to is_a_set to keep Ultrix happy.  Also
			  correctly calculate the length of the standard pwd.
			  so that we don't overwrite the end of the malloc()ed
			  string.
	* t_ktentry.c	- Remove isset logic, no differentiation for keytabs.


Tue May 16 10:35:54 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* t_dbentry.c, t_ktentry.c - new test modules for encode/decode
		functions.  These convert to and from krb5_db_entry and
		krb5_keytab_entry and verify contents.
	* adm_kt_enc.c	- Fix bug encoding integer values.


Tue May 9 15:21:49 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* adm_conn.c	- use profile information to locate the admin_server.
			  Also, return the correct value from krb5_adm_connect
			  instead of always returning zero.
	* adm_{kw,kt}_{enc,dec}.c - New modules to [en/de]code administrative
			  protocol keyword=value pairs and keytab entries.


Fri Apr 28 09:47:29 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)

	Create a new library consisting of functions which communicate with
	the administrative server here.  These modules replace the originals
	which used to be in libkrb5.

	adm_rw.c	- Remove ntohl/htonl in favor of byte blasting.

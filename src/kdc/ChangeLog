Tue Oct 11 22:11:09 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* do_as_req.c (process_as_req): Don't assume that the request
		server's realm name is null terminated.  Compare the
		request server against changepw/kerberos using
		krb5_principal_compare.

Tue Oct  4 16:42:16 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* kdc_util.c (kdc_rdreq_keyproc): Add widen.h and narrow.h around
		keyproc call so that the argument types are widened.

	* kdc_util.c, kdc_util.h (realm_compare): Change realm_compare so
		that both arguments are principals.  This makes it less
		confusing....

	* kdc_util.c (add_to_transited): Folded in Tony Andrea's changes
		so that add_to_transited doesn't assume that the contents
		of a krb5_data->data are null terminated.

	* do_tgs_req.c (process_tgs_req): Add the realm of the presented
	  tgt if it is different from the local realm (cross-realm) and it
	  is different than the realm of the client (since the realm of
	  the client is already implicitly part of the transited list and
	  should not be explicitly listed).

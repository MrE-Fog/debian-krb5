Thu Feb 16 20:12:23 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* configure.in:  Use AC_HAVE_HEADER rather than AC_HEADER_CHECK.
	(Fixes resulting #define names to HAVE_XXX rather than HAS_XXX,
	which is not only consistent but also matches what's in sysincl.h.)

            windows doesn't have them.
        * Makefile.in: 
           - changed macros with ${...} to $(...) since nmake barfs on {}.
           - added windows only make preamble 
           - split the all target into unix and windows branches

Fri Feb 10 14:54:26 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

		instead of AC_SIZEOF_TYPE.

        * configure.in:
        * wordsize.h: Don't use BITS16, BITS32, etc. anymore.  Use
                autoconf's SIZEOF_INT and SIZEOF_LONG definitions to make
                things work.

Mon Jan 30 15:43:19 1995  Chris Provenzano  (proven@mit.edu)

	* func-proto.h Added krb5_keytype arg to rb5_rdreq_key_proc.

	* func-proto.h (krb5_send_tgs()) Changed krb5_enctype arg to
		krb5_enctype *, a NULL terminated array of encryption types.

	* func-proto.h Added prototypes for krb5_get_for_creds(),
		krb5_set_default_in_tkt_etypes(), and
		krb5_get_default_in_tkt_etypes().
	
	* krb5.h Added fields to krb5_context to support default etypes.

		and krb5_authdatatype as int.

	$(INSTALL_DATA).
	(ET_HEADERS): new variable for the names of the headers that
	lib/krb5/error_tables builds and installs here (so that they get
	pushed out to the installed include directory.)
	(BUILT_HEADERS): locally built headers, for all, install, and
	clean.
	(clean): delete built and et headers.

Fri Nov 18 01:15:00 1994  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: use KRB5_POSIX_LOCKS, AC_EGREP_HEADER. (from
	epeisach).

	* encryption.h (krb5_string_to_key, krb5_random_key): Change
		internal calling signature to pass in the encryption
		block, so that the encryption type in the keyblock
		structure can be properly initialized.

Thu Nov  3 16:38:44 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* encryption.h (krb5_keyblock): Added a field to hold an
		encryption type in the keyblock field --- so routines have
		a hint of which encryption type they should use.

	* error_def.h: Add support for the kv5m error table.  (For magic

		beginning of the file.  Otherwise the other tests won't
		get the CCOPTS flags correct while doing the feature
		tests. 

Tue Oct 25 23:54:25 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* ext-proto.h (strdup): If the header files have strdup, don't try

Tue Oct  4 14:51:32 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* encryption.h: Cast various potential shorts to ints.  This is

Mon Oct  3 18:45:55 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* kdb.h: Add magic number to _krb5_db_entry.  (This among other
	things will cause a backwards incompatible change to the database
	format.)  The previous magic number changes also force a database
	format change; we will eventually need to completely redo how we
	encode the database format, so that it isn't structure layout
	dependent!

	* Makefile.in: Fix install to obey ${DESTDIR}, copy conf.h and
		osconf.h from build tree.

	* Makefile.in: Fix "make install" to use $(srcdir) for header files.

	for the ASN.1 routines.

Tue Aug 16 22:01:56 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: change test for USE_SYS_TIME_H to consistent
	(autoconf style) check for HAVE_SYS_TIME_H with
	TIME_WITH_SYS_TIME, and use them everywhere.
	* stock/osauto.h: get rid of USE_TIME_H.
	* stock/osconf.h: get rid of USE_TIME_H, rename USE_SYS_TIME_H.

Tue Aug  9 02:17:40 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* preauth.h: fix preauth function names as well (timestamp ->
	unixtime)

Mon Aug  8 22:36:24 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso at tsx-11)

	* asn1.h: ditto
	* configure.in: adding ISODE_DEFS, fixing ISODE_INCLUDE to dtrt

Tue Jun 21 23:54:40 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* pulling SEEK_SET, etc. out to avoid redef'ing in unistd.h

Tue Jun 21 00:50:46 1994  Mark W. Eichin  (eichin at mit.edu)

	* sysincl.h: SEEK_SET et. al. defined in terms of L_SET et. al. if
	they don't already exist.

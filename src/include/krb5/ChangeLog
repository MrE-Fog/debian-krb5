Mon Nov 21 14:43:14 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* func-proto.h (krb5_encode_kdc_rep, krb5_encrypt_tkt_part):
		Change to use new function prototypes.

	* encryption.h (krb5_eblock_keytype, krb5_eblock_enctype): Define
		new macros for finding the key type and encryption type of
		an encrypion block.

Fri Nov 18 17:53:38 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* kdb.h (KRB5_KDB_SUPPORT_DESMD5): Add new attribute which defines
		whether or not a server supports DES/MD5.

Fri Nov 18 01:28:47 1994  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (install): elide dependency so $(srcdir) works; use
	$(INSTALL_DATA).
	(ET_HEADERS): new variable for the names of the headers that
	lib/krb5/error_tables builds and installs here (so that they get
	pushed out to the installed include directory.)
	(BUILT_HEADERS): locally built headers, for all, install, and
	clean.
	(clean): delete built and et headers.

Fri Nov 18 01:15:00 1994  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: use KRB5_POSIX_LOCKS, AC_EGREP_HEADER. (from
	epeisach).

Thu Nov 10 22:04:19 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* hostaddr.h (krb5_address): Add magic number field.

Tue Nov  8 17:55:47 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* encryption.h (krb5_string_to_key, krb5_random_key): Change
		internal calling signature to pass in the encryption
		block, so that the encryption type in the keyblock
		structure can be properly initialized.

Thu Nov  3 16:38:44 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* encryption.h (krb5_keyblock): Added a field to hold an
		encryption type in the keyblock field --- so routines have
		a hint of which encryption type they should use.

	* error_def.h: Add support for the kv5m error table.  (For magic
		numbers.) 

Mon Oct 31 14:43:07 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* configure.in: Move WITH_CCOPTS and WITH_KRB5ROOT to the
		beginning of the file.  Otherwise the other tests won't
		get the CCOPTS flags correct while doing the feature
		tests. 

Tue Oct 25 23:54:25 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* ext-proto.h (strdup): If the header files have strdup, don't try
		to redefine it.

Fri Oct 14 00:40:01 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* mit-des.h: Add declaration for krb5_des_md5_cst_entry.

	* mit-des.h: Change name of the des_crc cryptosystem from
		krb5_des_cst_entry to krb5_des_crc_cst_entry.

Tue Oct  4 14:51:32 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* encryption.h: Cast various potential shorts to ints.  This is
		not quite right either, but the whole encryption interface
		needs to be fixed.

	* keytab.h (krb5_kt_ops.resolv): Resolve's first argument is a const.

	* encryption.h: Add magic number to encryption structures.

Mon Oct  3 18:45:55 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* kdb.h: Add magic number to _krb5_db_entry.  (This among other
	things will cause a backwards incompatible change to the database
	format.)  The previous magic number changes also force a database
	format change; we will eventually need to completely redo how we
	encode the database format, so that it isn't structure layout
	dependent!

	* Makefile.in: Fix install to obey ${DESTDIR}, copy conf.h and
		osconf.h from build tree.

	* Makefile.in: Fix "make install" to use $(srcdir) for header files.

Thu Sep 29 15:07:30 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* func_proto.h (krb5_realm_compare): Added prototype for functin
		donated by OpenVision.  (Compares two realms).

Wed Sep 21 18:10:55 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* func_proto.h (krb5_check_transited_list): Added prototype for
		function donated by Cybersafe.

Wed Aug 17 16:33:22 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso at tsx-11)

	* krb5.h (krb5_enc_kdc_rep_part): Added msg_type field.  Needed
	for the ASN.1 routines.

Tue Aug 16 22:01:56 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: change test for USE_SYS_TIME_H to consistent
	(autoconf style) check for HAVE_SYS_TIME_H with
	TIME_WITH_SYS_TIME, and use them everywhere.
	* stock/osauto.h: get rid of USE_TIME_H.
	* stock/osconf.h: get rid of USE_TIME_H, rename USE_SYS_TIME_H.

Tue Aug  9 02:17:40 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* preauth.h: fix preauth function names as well (timestamp ->
	unixtime)

Mon Aug  8 22:36:24 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso at tsx-11)

	* proto.h: Change preauthentication names to match official names
	which bcn and I agreed upon.

Tue Aug  2 03:39:14 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* acconfig.h: add HAVE_SETVBUF

	* configure.in: changes to make things saner when checking for
	ANSI_STDIO

Thu Jul 14 03:31:06 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in: some cleanup to not echo cruft

Tue Jun 28 19:09:21 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* error_def.h: folding in Harry's changes
	* asn1.h: ditto
	* configure.in: adding ISODE_DEFS, fixing ISODE_INCLUDE to dtrt

Tue Jun 21 23:54:40 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* pulling SEEK_SET, etc. out to avoid redef'ing in unistd.h

Tue Jun 21 00:50:46 1994  Mark W. Eichin  (eichin at mit.edu)

	* sysincl.h: SEEK_SET et. al. defined in terms of L_SET et. al. if
	they don't already exist.

Thu Jun 29 22:54:30 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* krb5.hin: special-case ultrix brokenness (again!) for
		KRB5_CONST; krb5.h breaks when typedef'ing while
		installed.  Yuck.

Tue Jun 27 16:14:38 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* krb5.hin - Reinstate KRB5_PROVIDE_PROTOTYPES.  This is needed for
		compilers which recognize prototypes but don't set __STDC__
		or _WINDOWS.

Thu Jun 22 16:03:07 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* syslog.h: reverse sense of KRB5_PROVIDE_PROTOTYPES
	* krb5.hin: special-case ultrix brokenness, reverse sense of
		KRB5_PROVIDE_PROTOTYPES (becomes KRB5_NO_PROTOTYPES);
		also, NO_NESTED_PROTOTYPES -> KRB5_NO_NESTED_PROTOTYPES
	* Makefile.in: don't install NO_NESTED_PROTOTYPES, HAS_VOID_TYPE,
		and KRB5_PROVIDE_PROTOTYPES symbols into krb5.h

Thu Jun 22 11:51:10 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* k5-int.h - Add pointer in krb5_context for database context.

Wed Jun 21 10:54:58 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in, krb5.hin: Don't include autoconf.h anymore; have
		the Makefile include the few configure symbols which
		krb5.h needs.

	* krb5.hin: Change PROTOTYPE -> KRB5_PROTOTYPE and 
		NPROTOTYPE -> KRB5_NPROTOTYPE.

Fri Jun 16 11:39:36 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in - Fix install logic for krb5.h and k5-int.h.

Sun Jun 11 09:20:29 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* krb5.hin: Add missing declaration of krb5_auth_con_initivector.

Sat Jun 10 22:10:46 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* krb5.hin: declare krb5_auth_context as
		struct _krb5_auth_context FAR *

Fri Jun  9 18:43:20 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* krb5.hin: Remove definition of the krb5_fulladdr structure, and
		the prototype for the unused function krb5_fulladdr_order.

	* configure.in: Remove standardized set of autoconf macros, which
		are now handled by CONFIG_RULES.  Use DO_SUBDIRS to
		recurse down subdirectories.

Fri Jun 9 12:02:02 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in(all-unix) : Add adm_err.h build target since it's not 
		built in lib/krb5/error_tables any more.  kadmin.old needs it.

Tue Jun  6 12:25:38 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* krb5.hin: Add prototype for krb5_524_conv_principal()

Tue May 30 10:59:13 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (clean-unix): Remove built header files krb5.h
		krb5_err.h kdb5_err.h kv5m_err.h asn1_err.h 

Wed May 24 10:54:34 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in	- Change $< to explicit target names when generating
			  error table header files.  OSF/1 and Ultrix-native
			  make only expand $< on suffix rules.

Tue May 23 22:07:02 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* krb5.hin: Remove krb5_encode_ticket as it does not exist in
		library. 

Tue May 23 15:08:54 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in, krb5.hin: Move krb5.h to krb5.hin,
		and build krb5.h from krb5.hin and the error table
		include files, which are now built in this directory.
		This way, krb5.h is the only include file that we need to
		install.

	* k5-int.h: Move the sockets specific setup out of k5-config.h to
		  k5-sockets.h, and modify k5-int to include k5-sockets.h
		  (if it is requested by NEED_SOCKETS) after including
		  krb5.h.  This keeps the gdb type numbers the same across
		  .o files, so that recent binuntils can compress the
		  debugging information in executables linked with a
		  debugging library.

Mon May 22 10:24:49 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in	- (install) Always perform install actions using
			  $(INSTALL_DATA).
	* configure.in	- locate install program.

Wed May  3 10:32:18 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* krb5.h: (krb5_auth_con_setports): Added missing prototype.
	          (krb5_auth_con_getkey): Added as well.

Wed May 03 03:30:51 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

	* krb5.h: (krb5_recvauth()): No longer needs the rc_type arg.

Mon May  1 17:06:51 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* krb5.h: (krb5_set_config_files): Added const to prototype

Sat Apr 29 07:10:02 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@lurch.mit.edu>

	* krb5.h (krb5_set_config_files): Added new function prototype.

Fri Apr 28 01:44:51 1995  Chris Provenzano  (proven@mit.edu)

	* krb5.h (krb5_send_tgs()) : Removed krb5_cksumtype argument.

Thu Apr 27 21:36:01 1995  Chris Provenzano  (proven@mit.edu)

        * krb5.h : Added mask AP_OPTS_WIRE_MASK.

Thu Apr 27 18:27:36 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)
	
	* Makefile.in: duplicate copying the profile.h file for the PC.

Thu Apr 27 17:57:36 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* krb5.h: krb5_mk_req somehow got INTERFACE added to it--removed it.

Tue Apr 25 21:58:23 1995  Chris Provenzano  (proven@mit.edu)

	* krb5.h (krb5_fulladdr) : Change port to be of type krb5_address.
	* krb5.h (krb5_auth_con_genaddrs()) : Added flags for new routine.
	* krb5.h (krb5_get_for_creds()) : Removed prototype.
	* krb5.h (krb5_get_cred_via_tkt()) : Added prototype.
	* krb5.h (krb5_mk_ncred(), krb5_mk_1cred(), krb5_rd_cred()):
		Updated prototype to include auth_context.

Fri Apr 21 08:58:50 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@lurch.mit.edu>

	* krb5.h: krb5_princ_aref() doesn't work, and isn't used anywhere.
		Removed.  (So all of macros.h is gone.)

	* krb5.h, k5-int.h: Moved struct _krb5_context to k5-int.h

Thu Apr 20 12:15:54 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* krb5.h: Needs SIZEOF_INT, SIZEOF_LONG defined for the PC.

Wed Apr 29 10:00:00 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: duplicated the file copying stuff from 
           ..\gssapi\generic so that all the copying stuff can be
           found in one place.

Thu Apr 20 11:32:09 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* krb5.h, k5-int.h: Inlined the following include files, to
		simplify the header files which actually need to be
		installed: wordsize.h, base-defs.h, hostaddr.h,
		fieldbits.h, proto.h, macros.h, error_def.h, safepriv.h,
		ccache.h, rcache.h, keytab.h, func-proto.h, k5-free.h.
		Also moved the #include of k5-config.h and k5-errors.h to
		k5-int.h.

Wed Apr 19 13:23:39 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* krb5.h: Added default_realm pointer to krb5_context

Thu Apr 13 16:05:08 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* bsdlib.h, bstring.h, fake-std.h, syslog.h:  __STDC__ conditionals
           also check for the _WINDOWS define.
        * krb5.h: added FAR to pointers visible to the world.

Tue Mar 28 18:12:32 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* Makefile.in (KRB5_HEADERS, install):  `Make install' now works.
	* configure.in (WITH_KRB5ROOT):  For `make install'.
	* krb5.h:  Include "k5-errors.h" rather than "errors.h".

Fri Mar 17 19:10:41 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* krb5.h:  Move <sys/types> and u_long (etc) code to krb5/k5-config.h.
	It is needed there when NEED_SOCKETS is defined.
	* Makefile.in (all-mac, clean-mac):  Add.

Wed Mar 15 20:27:57 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: added recursion into krb5 for the PC.

Fri Mar 10 10:18:50 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

	* krb5.h Added empty structure declaration of krb5_auth_context.

	* k5-int.h Moved #include "adm_defs.h" to krb5.h

Thu Mar  2 23:24:00 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	Make include files begin to work on the Macintosh.

	* k5-int.h:  Remove krb5/ from #includes.  Rearrange #includes
	so that time_t is defined before kdb.h is included.
	* krb5.h:  Include k5-config.h first, so its #define's can
	control the rest of the file.  If <sys/types.h> is not present,
	define u_long, etc, manually.

Wed Feb 22 18:31:12 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* k5-int.h:  Remove commented-out <widen.h> and <narrow.h>.
	* krb5.h: Same as old krb5/krb5.h, as a start.  Gradually things
	that don't need to be exported will be moved from krb5.h into
	k5-int.h (and vice verse for e.g. function prototypes).

Wed Jan 25 19:19:38 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	Make it possible to #include "..." without using slashes,
	for Macintosh support.

	* krb5.h:  New file, the externally visible interface to
	Kerberos V5.  Currently the whole kitchen sink, to bootstrap.
	* k5-int.h:  New file, the internally visible declarations
	needed by source files that are part of the Kerberos V5 library
	itself.  Currently the same whole kitchen sink, to bootstrap.

Fri Nov 18 00:16:31 1994  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: use WITH_CCOPTS.

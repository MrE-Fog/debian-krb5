	Make include files begin to work on the Macintosh.

	* k5-int.h:  Remove krb5/ from #includes.  Rearrange #includes
	so that time_t is defined before kdb.h is included.
	* krb5.h:  Include k5-config.h first, so its #define's can
	control the rest of the file.  If <sys/types.h> is not present,
	define u_long, etc, manually.

	* k5-int.h:  Remove commented-out <widen.h> and <narrow.h>.
	* krb5.h: Same as old krb5/krb5.h, as a start.  Gradually things
	that don't need to be exported will be moved from krb5.h into
	k5-int.h (and vice verse for e.g. function prototypes).

	Make it possible to #include "..." without using slashes,
	for Macintosh support.

	* krb5.h:  New file, the externally visible interface to
	Kerberos V5.  Currently the whole kitchen sink, to bootstrap.
	* k5-int.h:  New file, the internally visible declarations
	needed by source files that are part of the Kerberos V5 library
	itself.  Currently the same whole kitchen sink, to bootstrap.

	* configure.in: use WITH_CCOPTS.

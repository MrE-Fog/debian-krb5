	* Makefile.tmpl (link): Don't use "-model far" when linking on the
		Power PC.  It has no meaning.

	* macfiles.sh: Improved matching of the SRCS declaration.  It must
		not be commented out; it must start on the first column of
		the line.

	* Makefile.tmpl (KH): Fix typos in Dan's original template.

	* Makefile.tmpl, macfiles.sh: New files, for danw's changes to

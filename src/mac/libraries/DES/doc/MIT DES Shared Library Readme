Introduction
------------
This is the initial release of the new MIT DES library for use with
GSS-Kerberos 5.  You should use it instead of internal Kerb5 DES
functions, since those will change in the future.

This release is meant for use with the MIT GSS-Kerberos5-1.1a1
distribution.

This release is intended as a starting point for programmers to
replace their current DES calls.  A future GSS-Kerberos 5 distribution
will fully integrate the DES library.

If you need to distribute this library before that release, please
contact macdev@mit.edu .

Installing
----------
* Unstuff the "MIT DES Shared Library 1.0.sit" archive (as you may
have already done).

* This will give you a "DES" folder. Copy that folder into the
":mac:libraries:" folder in your GSS/Krb5 tree.

Using the DES Library
---------------------
In your sources, include <des.h> and make sure
"{GSS/Krb5}:mac:libraries:DES:"
is in your System access paths.

In your project:
	PPC: add deslib.PPC
	CFM-68K: add deslib.68K
	classic 68K: add deslib.CFMGlue.c

Before making any DES calls from classic 68K or weakly-linked CFM
code, you should call DESLibraryIsPresent(), and check the result to
make sure it is true.

(For classic 68K code, DESLibraryIsPresent() is declared in
deslib.CFMGlue.h; for CFM code, it is a macro in des.h.)

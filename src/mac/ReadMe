To Build the Macintosh version of Kerberos 5 and GSS:

--- Installing tools ---

	1) Install CodeWarrior Pro 2 with MPW

	2) Download MacPerl and MacPerl MPW tool from
	<ftp://sunsite.cnlab-switch.ch/software/platform/macos/perl/>

	3) Install MacPerl and MacPerl MPW tool

--- Preparing Kerberos v5 build tree ---

	4) Launch MPW

	5) Set directory in MPW to the top level of Kerberos 5 distribution ("GSS-Kerberos v5 1.0.5")

	6) Execute "perl :mac:macfile_gen.pl" in MPW

	7) Build target "create-directories" in MPW
	
	8) Open projects in ":mac:libraries:Metrowerks:CW Pro 2" in your CW Pro 2 IDE (the projects 
	will not work correctly with CW Pro 3), and build them. You need to build the Runtime libraries
	before building the C libraries.
		
--- Building libraries ---

	9) Build target "all" in MPW. Wait.

--- Building the Cygnus Network Security Application ---

	10) Open the project file :mac:kconfig:kconfig.µ in CodeWarrior Pro 2 IDE
	
	11) Select Make from the Project menu

--- Installation ---

	The following assumes that you have followed the steps above to build
	the Kerberos libraries.  What you now have supports both the Kerberos
	and GSS APIs.  Each is supported as both a shared library and a Code 
	Warrior static link library for 68k Macs.  Following are the binary
	components provided in this release:

	   * Code Fragment Manager libraries for 68k Macintosh
	     (:mac:libraries:GSSLibrary and :mac:libraries:GSSLib)
	    
	   * Code Warrior static libraries for 68k Macintosh
	     (:mac:libraries:libgss and :mac:libraries:libkrb5)

	   * Cygnus Network Security Configuration program
	     (:mac:kconfig:CNS Config)
	    
	   * Sample krb5.ini file using CYGNUS.COM as the default realm
	     (:mac:krb5.ini)
	     
	   * An include directory containing the files necessary
	     for development (:include)

	   To install the Kerberos system:

	   1) Drop the :mac:krb5.ini file into the "Preferences"
	   folder contained in the "System Folder".
	   
	   2) To install the shared libraries (optional), simply copy the 
	   "GSSLib" file to the "Extensions" folder in the "System Folder".


--- Getting Started Programming ---

	You may program using either the Kerberos or GSS APIs.  As delivered, the
	libraries containing the GSS API are complete.  They do not rely on the
	krb5 library.

	To add Kerberos utility to a Code Warrior based application:

	   1) Decide on whether to use CFM or static libraries.

	   2) Decide on whether to use ther Kerberos or GSS APIs.

	   3) Drag the appropriate library into your project
	     (One of: :mac:libraries:libgss, mac:libraries:libkrb5,
	     :mac:libraries:GSS Library or :mac:libraries:Kerberos 5 Library).

	   4) Set the project options to 4 byte integers and enums treated as ints.

In any complex software, there will be bugs. Please send bug reports or
other problems you may uncover to the e-mail address
@b{krb5-bugs@@mit.edu}.  Please mention which version of the Kerberos V5
distribution you are using, and whether you have made any private
changes.  Bug reports that include proposed fixes are especially
welcome.  If you do include fixes, please send them using either context
diffs or unified diffs (using @samp{diff -c} or @samp{diff -u},
respectively).

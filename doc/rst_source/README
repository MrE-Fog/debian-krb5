To build the documentation as HTML pages run:

sphinx-build source_dir  destination_dir

where 
source_dir is the source directory which includes configuration file conf.py and all source files;
destination_dir is the directory for the built documentation.

Once completed, the newly generated HTML documentation can be viewed from the browser by pointing to destination_dir/index.html

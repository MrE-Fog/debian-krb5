	* library.tex (internalfunc): Define \internalfunc, which prints a
		disclaimer in front of "internal functions".  We should
		move them somewhere else, but for now, let's start marking
		those functions which we believe are internal.

	* krb5.tex: Documented changed interfaces to krb5_encode_kdc_rep
		and krb5_encrypt_tkt_part.  Document krb5_encode_kdc_rep,
		krb5_decode_kdc_rep, krb5_encrypt_tkt_part,
		krb5_decrypt_tkt_part, and krb5_send_tgs as all internal
		functions.

	* krb5.tex: Fixed typo; extra space in \funcname{ krb5_recvauth}.

	* Makefile: Added better dependencies to do two-pass latex runs
		automatically.  Make "make clean" clean up the tex temp
		files.

Source tree organization (15 Jun 1994):

admin:		administrative tools	
		aname: manipulate aname/lname translation database
		convert: convert a V4 database to a V5 database
		create: create database
		destroy: destroy database
		edit: edit database [the most useful of the bunch]
		stash: store db key for unattended service

autotools:	Tools to allow rebuild the configure scripts; requires that 
		you have GNU autoconf installed.

appl:		applications
		bsd:  The Berkeley rlogin/rsh/rcp suite
		movemail: Emacs 18.57 'movemail' program with Kerberos
			hooks for POP support.
		popper: Berkeley POP server, with Kerberos and other
			athena mods
		gss-sample: sample client & server using the GSSAPI library
		sample: sample client & server (using byte stream sockets)
		simple: another sample client & server (using datagrams)
		telnet:	telnet client (v4 & v5 kerberized, plus other goodies)
			libtelnet: support for telnet/telnetd
			telnet: the client-side
			telnetd: BSD UNIX telnet daemon
			login: a version of login(8) which has the '-f' flag
				necessary for using authenticated telnet
				connections without a password
		user-user: sample client & server using the user-to-user
			protocol features.  (NOTE: the client and server
			programs are somewhat "backwards" in terms of how
			they call the Kerberos 5 routines.  Don't let this
			confuse you.)

clients:	base-level kerberos clients
		kinit: get tickets using password
		klist: list ticket cache
		kdestroy: destroy ticket cache
		ksu: kerberized su program

config:		configuration control for source
		>>> look at site.def, vaxbsd.cf, ultrix.cf, ibm.cf in
		>>> particular for hints on things you might want to modify.
		>>> Ignore the comments on the X11 stuff for now.

doc:		documentation hierarchy
		api: The Kerberos api

include:	include hierarchy
		krb5: kerberos-specific includes
		kerberosIV: copies of kerberos v4 include files (used
			for some programs which support both)

isode:		isode hierarchy.  A subset of ISODE 8.0.  Used only for
			the autoconf setup.  

kadmin:		Remote kerberos administration tools
		client: The client program
		kpasswd: User-client which allos users to change their 
			passwords
		server: The server daemon
		v4server: A V4 kadmin server which updates a V5 database

kdc:		Kerberos Server/Key Distribution Center

krb524:		Program which issues krb4 tickets when handed a krb5 TGT

lib:		library hierarchy
		crypto: The cryptographic routines
			crc-32:	CRC-32 function(s)
			des: MIT DES library
			md4: MD4 code from Internet RFC 1186B
			md5: MD5 code from Internet 
			os: Operating-system or configuration-specific code

		kdb:	database interface routines

		krb425:	link-level compatibility library; lets you link
			v4 applications with v5 back-end code

		krb5: The Kerberos library
			asn.1:	ASN.1 definitions & glue files
				The current set-up assumes that you
				have ISODE 7.0 (or later) installed.
				A subset of ISODE can be found in the
				same directory where you picked up the
				Kerberos distribution.

			ccache: credentials cache
				file: file descriptor-based ccache
				stdio: STDIO-based ccache
			error_tables: Common Error description files & headers
			free:	routines to free various allocated data 
				structures 
			gssapi: GSSAPI implementation for Kerberos V5
			keytab:	server key table routines
				file:	STDIO-based keytab
			krb:	Main kerberos library functions
			os:	Operating-system or configuration-specific code
			posix:	POSIX routines provided for systems
				that don't have them
			rcache:	authenticator replay-cache code
	
slave:		Routines to propagate the Kerberos database from the
			master to the slave databases (kprop/kpropd)

tests:		various tests
		create: create a bunch of principals in a KDC database
		verify: verify that the principals have the right keys
		hammer: "hammer" the KDC with requests to help assure
			proper KDC operation

util:		Utilities
		et:	The com_err library
		ss:	The subsystem library
		makedepend:	Program to rebuild the makefile dependencies
		unifdef:	Removes #ifdef/#endif code

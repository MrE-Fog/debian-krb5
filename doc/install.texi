@chapter Introduction

This document describes the procedures necessary to compile Kerberos V5
from the source distribution, and then to install it at a particular
site.  The reader is assumed to be familiar with C/Unix development
tools. 

In any complex piece of software, there will be bugs.  In addition, you
may find portability problems when you try to build Kerberos V5 on a
platform which we haven't tried building yet.  Please send bugs or other
problems you may uncover to the e-mail address @b{krb5-bugs@@mit.edu}.
Please mention which version of the Kerberos V5 distribution you are
using, and whether you have made any private changes.  Bug reports that
include context diffs describe the fix are especially welcome.

Please note that there are still a number of aspects of Kerberos V5
which will likely change before the 1.0 release.  In particular, the
syntax and the names of the configuration files, @file{krb.conf} and
@file{krb.realms}, are very likely to change in the near future.  In
addition the location of the executable programs will also likely change
as well.

As these changes occur, we will update the documentation accordingly.

@chapter How Kerberos Works: A Schematic Description

This section provides a simplified description of a general user's
interaction with the Kerberos system.  This interaction happens
transparently--users don't need to know and probably don't care about
what's going on--but Kerberos administrators might find a schematic
description of the process useful.  The description glosses over a lot
of details; for more information, see @i{Kerberos: An Authentication
Service for Open Network Systems}, a paper presented at Winter USENIX
1988, in Dallas, Texas.

@node Network Services , Kerberos Tickets, How Kerberos Works, How Kerberos Works
@section Network Services and Their Client Programs

In an environment that provides network services, you use @dfn{client}
programs to request service from @dfn{server} programs that are
somewhere on the network.  Suppose you have logged in to a workstation
and you want to @samp{rlogin} to another machine.  You use the local
@samp{rlogin} client program to contact the remote machine's
@samp{rlogin} service daemon.

@node Kerberos Tickets, The Kerberos Database, Network Services , How Kerberos Works
@section Kerberos Tickets

Under Kerberos, the @samp{rlogin} service program allows a client to
login to a remote machine if it can provide a Kerberos @dfn{ticket} for
the request.  This ticket proves the identity of the person who has used
the client program to access the server program.

In order to use a ticket, the client must also have possession of the
@dfn{ticket session key}.  This combination of the ticket and the ticket
session key is known as a @dfn{credential}.


@node The Kerberos Database, The Ticket-Granting Ticket, Kerberos Tickets, How Kerberos Works
@section The Kerberos Database

Kerberos will give you tickets only if you have an entry in the Kerberos
server's @dfn{Kerberos database}.  Your database entry includes your
Kerberos @dfn{principal} (which is often simply just your username), and
your Kerberos password.  Every Kerberos user must have an entry in this
database.

@node The Ticket-Granting Ticket, Network Services and the Master Database, The Kerberos Database, How Kerberos Works
@section The Ticket-Granting Ticket

The @samp{kinit} command prompts for your password, and if you enter it
successfully, you will obtain a set of @dfn{ticket-granting ticket}
credentials.  As illustrated below, client programs use these
credentials to get other Kerberos credentials as needed.

Your credentials are stored in a @dfn{credentials cache}, which is often
simply just a file in @file{/tmp}.  The credentials cache is also
referred to as the @dfn{ticket file}, especially in Kerberos V4
documentation.  It should be noted, however, that a credentials cache
does not have to be stored in a file.

@node Network Services and the Master Database, The User-Kerberos Interaction, The Ticket-Granting Ticket, How Kerberos Works
@section Network Services and the Master Database

The master database also contains entries for all network services that
require Kerberos authentication.  Suppose for instance that your site
has a machine @samp{laughter.mit.edu} that requires Kerberos
authentication from anyone who wants to @samp{rlogin} to it.  The host's
Kerberos realm is @samp{ATHENA.MIT.EDU}.  

This service must be registered in the Kerberos database, using the
proper service name, which in this case is
@samp{host/laughter.mit.edu@@ATHENA.MIT.EDU}.  The @kbd{/} character
separates the various @dfn{components} of the Kerberos principal; the
@kbd{@@} character separates the realm name from the rest of the
principal name.  The first component, @samp{host}, denotes the name or
type of the service that is being offered --- generic host-level access
to the machine.  The second component, @samp{laughter.mit.edu} names the
specific machine which is offering this service.  There will generally
be many different machinees offering one particular type of service, and
the second component serves to separate themselves out from one another.

For each service, there must also be a @dfn{service key} stored in the
Kerberos database.  This service key is the equivalent of the service's
password, and must be kept secure, since data which is meant to be only
read by the serivce is encrypted in this key.  Service keys are stored
in @dfn{key tables}, which are also commonly known as @dfn{srvtab
files}.  Service keys which are meant to be used by services which run
as root are often stored in the file @file{/etc/v5srvtab}.

@node The User-Kerberos Interaction,  , Network Services and the Master Database, How Kerberos Works
@section The User-Kerberos Interaction

Suppose that you (in the guise of a general user) walk up to a workstation
intending to login to it, and then @samp{rlogin} to the machine @samp{laughter}.
Here's what happens.

@enumerate

@item You login to the workstation and use the @samp{kinit} command
to to get a ticket-granting ticket.
This command prompts you for your Kerberos password.  (On some systems
which have a modified @samp{/bin/login} program, this may be done as
part of the login process, not requiring the user to run a separate
program).

@enumerate

@item The @samp{kinit} command sends your request to the Kerberos master
server machine.  The server software looks for your principal name's
entry in the Kerberos database.

@item If this entry exists, the Kerberos server creates and returns a
ticket-granting ticket and the key which allows you to use it, encrypted
in your password.  If @samp{kinit} can decrypt the Kerberos reply using
the password you provide, it stores this ticket in a credentials cache
on your local machine for later use.  The name of the credentials cache
cab be specified in the @samp{KRB5_CCNAME} environment variable.  If
this variable is not set, the name of the file will be
@file{/tmp/krb5cc_<uid>}, where <uid> is the UNIX user-id, represented
in decimal.
@end enumerate

@item Now you use the @samp{rlogin} client to try to access the machine
@samp{laughter}.

@example
host% @b{rlogin  laughter}
@end example

@enumerate

@item The @samp{rlogin} client checks your ticket file to see if you
have a ticket for @samp{laughter}'s @samp{host} service.
You don't, so @samp{rlogin} uses the credential cache's ticket-granting
ticket to make a request to the master server's ticket-granting service.

@item This ticket-granting service receives the
@samp{host/laughter.mit.edu} request and looks in the master database
for an @samp{host/laughter.mit.edu} entry.  If the entry exists, the
ticket-granting service issues you a ticket for that service.  That
ticket is also cached in your credentials cache.

@item The @samp{rlogin} client now uses that ticket to request service from
the @samp{laughter} @samp{rlogin} service program.  The service program
lets you login to that host if the ticket is valid.

@end enumerate
@end enumerate

@chapter Building Kerberos

Starting with the Beta 4 distribution, we have started using a new
configuration system, which was built using the Free Software
Foundation's autoconf program.  This system will hopefully make Kerberos
V5 much simpler to build for most people, and reduce the amount of
effort required in porting Kerberos V5 to a new platform.

@end menu

@node Build Requirements, Unpacking the Sources, Building Kerberos, Building Kerberos
@section Build Requirements

In order to build Kerberos V5, you will need roughly 60-70
megabytes.  The exact amount will vary depending on the platform and
whether the distribution is compiled with debugging symbol tables (using
the @code{-g} option) or not.

If you wish to keep keep a @dfn{build tree}, which contains the compiled
@file{*.o} file and executables, separate from your source tree, you
will either need a @samp{make} program which supports @samp{VPATH}, or
you will need to use a tool such as @samp{lndir} to produce a symbol
link tree for your build tree.

@node Unpacking the Sources, Doing the Build, Build Requirements, Building Kerberos
@section Unpacking the Sources

The first step in each of these build procedures is to unpack the source
distribution.  The Kerberos V5 distribution comes in two compressed tar
files.  The first file, which is generally named @file{krb5.src.tar.gz},
contains the sources for all of Kerberos except for the crypto library,
which is found in the file @file{krb5.crypto.tar.gz}.

Both files should be unpacked in the same directory, such as
@file{/u1/krb5}.  (In the rest of this document, we will assume that you
have chosen to unpack the Kerberos V5 source distribution in this
directory.)


@node Doing the Build, Testing the Build, Unpacking the Sources, Building Kerberos
@section Doing the Build

You have a number of different options as far as how you build Kerberos.
If you only need to build Kerberos for one platform, using a single
directory tree which contains both the source files and the object files
is the simplest.  

However, if you need to maintain Kerberos for a large number of
platforms, you will probably want to use separate build trees for each
platform.  

@menu
* Building within a single tree::  
* Building with separate build directories::  
* Building using lndir::        
@end menu

@node Building within a single tree, Building with separate build directories, Doing the Build, Doing the Build
@subsection Building within a single tree

If you don't want separate build trees for each architecture, then
use the following abbreviated procedure.

@enumerate
@item @samp{cd /u1/krb5/src}
@item @samp{configure}
@item @samp{make}
@end enumerate

That's it!

@node Building with separate build directories, Building using lndir, Building within a single tree, Doing the Build
@subsection Building with separate build directories

If you wish to keep separate build directories for each platform, you
can do so using the following procedure.  (Note, this requires that your
@samp{make} program support @samp{VPATH}.  GNU's gmake will provide this
functionality, for example.)  If your @samp{make} program does not
support this, see the next section.

For example, if you wish to create a build directory for pmax binaries
you might use the following procedure:

@enumerate
@item @samp{mkdir /u1/krb5/pmax}
@item @samp{cd /u1/krb5/pmax}
@item @samp{../src/configure}
@item @samp{make}
@end enumerate

@node Building using lndir,  , Building with separate build directories, Doing the Build
@subsection Building using lndir

If you wish to keep separate build directories for each platform, and
your @samp{make} program does not support @samp{VPATH}, all is not lost.
You can use the @samp{lndir} program to create a symbolic link tree farm
in your build directory.

For example, if you wish to create a build directory for solaris binaries
you might use the following procedure:

@enumerate
@item @samp{mkdir /u1/krb5/solaris}
@item @samp{cd /u1/krb5/solaris}
@item @samp{/u1/krb5/src/util/lndir ../src}
@item @samp{configure}
@item @samp{make}
@end enumerate

@node Testing the Build, Configure options, Doing the Build, Building Kerberos
@section Testing the Build

The Kerberos V5 distribution comes with built-in regression tests.  To
run them, simply type

@example
% @b{make check}
@end example

while in the top-level build directory.

@node Configure options, Operating System Incompatibilities, Testing the Build, Building Kerberos
@section Configure options

There are a number of options to Configure which you can use to control
how the Kerberos distribution is built.  The following table lists the
most commonly used options to Kerberos V5's configure program.

@table @code

@item --with-cc=COMPILER

Use @code{COMPILER} as the C compiler.

@item --with-ccopts=FLAGS

Use @code{FLAGS} as the default set of C compiler flags.

Please take note that if you use the native Ultrix compiler on a
DECstation you are likely to lose if you pass no flags to cc; md4.c
takes an estimated 33 million years to compile if you provide neither
the @samp{-g} flag nor the @samp{-O} flag to @samp{cc}.

@item --with-cppopts=CPPOPTS 

Use @code{CPPOPTS} as the default set of C preprocessor flags.  The most
common use of this option is to select certain @code{#define}'s for use
with the operating system's system include files.

@item --with-krb5-root=DIR

By default, Kerberos will expect its configuration files to be in
the directory @file{/krb5}.  This can be changed by using this option.

@item  --with-krb4=KRB4DIR 

This option enables Kerberos V4 backwards compatibility.  The directory
specified by @code{KRB4DIR} specifies where the V4 include files should
be found (@file{/KRB4DIR/include}) as well as where the V4 Kerberos
library should be found (@file{/KRB4DIR/lib}).

@end table

@node Operating System Incompatibilities, Compile-time configuration files, Configure options, Building Kerberos

@subsection Ultrix 4.2/3

On the MIPS platform, md4.c and md5.c can not be compiled with the
optimizer set at level 1.  (Either -O or -g will work; leaving ccopts
null won't.)  The optimizer isn't hung; it just takes an exponentially
long time.  Calculations estimate around 4 billion years....

@node Alpha OSF/1 V2.0, BSDI, Ultrix 4.2/3, Operating System Incompatibilities

md4.c can not be compiled with the optimizer on.  (This could possibly
be the same sort of bug as found in @ref{Ultrix 4.2/3}, but that seems
rather remarkable.)

(Reported by Marc Kenig)

@node BSDI, Solaris versions 2.0 through 2.3, Alpha OSF/1 V2.0, Operating System Incompatibilities
@subsection BSDI

BSDI reportedly has a bad sed which causes it to go into an infinite
loop during the build.  The workaround is to get a sed from somewhere
else, such as GNU.

@node Solaris versions 2.0 through 2.3, Solaris 2.X, BSDI, Operating System Incompatibilities
@subsection Solaris versions 2.0 through 2.3

The @code{gethostbyname()} routine is broken; it does not return a fully
qualified domain name, even if you are using the DNS.  Since Kerberos
V5 uses the fully qualified domain name as the second component of a
service principal (i.e, "host/tsx-11.mit.edu@@ATHENA.MIT.EDU"), this
causes problems for servers who try to figure out their own fully
qualified domain name.  (It turns out clients win because Kerberos
calls gethostbyname() and then calls gethostbyaddr() on the address,
and SunSoft didn't screw up gethostbyaddr() except when it is your own
local hostname!)

Workarounds:  

@enumerate

@item   Supply your own resolver library.

@item   Upgrade to Solaris 2.4

@item   Make sure your /etc/nsswitch.conf has the line:

@example
hosts:      files dns
@end example

and then in /etc/hosts, make sure there is a line with your
workstation's IP address and hostname, with the fully qualified domain
name first.  Example:

@example
18.172.1.4      dcl.mit.edu dcl
@end example

@end enumerate

@node Solaris 2.X,  , Solaris versions 2.0 through 2.3, Operating System Incompatibilities
@subsection Solaris 2.X

You *must* compile Kerberos V5 *without* the UCB compatibility libraries.  

This means that @file{/usr/ucblib} must *not* be in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable when you compile it.  

Alternatively you can place the @code{-i} option on the cc line.  So you
can put @code{--with-ccopts=-i} on the configure line.  (Thanks to Dan
Nessett for this suggestion.)

Define this if you want to allow the KDC to modify the Kerberos

well as the failure count information.

causes the database to be modified (and thus need to be locked)
frequently.

@end table

@node Using Autoconf,  , Compile-time configuration files, Building Kerberos
@section Using Autoconf

(If you are not a developer, you can skip this section.)

In most of the Kerberos V5 source directories, there is a
@file{configure} script which automatically determines the compilation
environment and creates the proper Makefiles for a particular platform.
These @file{configure} files are generated using @samp{autoconf} version
2.1, which can be found in the @file{src/util/autoconf} directory in the
distribution.

Normal users will not need to worry about running @samp{autoconf}; the
distribution comes with the @file{configure} files already prebuilt.
Developers who wish to modify the @file{configure.in} files should see
@ref{Top, , Overview, autoconf, The Autoconf Manual}.  

Note that in order to run @samp{autoconf}, you must have GNU m4 in your
path.  Before you use the autoconf in the Kerberos V5 source tree, you
may also need to run @samp{configure}, and then run @samp{make} in the
@file{src/util/autoconf} directory in order to properly set up
@samp{autoconf}.

One tool which is provided for the convenience of developers can be
found in @file{src/util/reconf}.  This program should be run while the
current directory is the source directory.  It will automatically rebuild any
@file{configure} files which need rebuilding.  If you know that you have
made a change that will require that all the @file{configure} files need to
be rebuilt from scratch, specify the @code{--reconf} option: 

@example
% cd /u1/krb5/src
% ./util/reconf --force

@node Installation,  , Building Kerberos, Top
@chapter Installation

When you are installing Kerberos for the first time at a site, you must
first decide on the Realm name you will use for your site, and select a
machine to serve as the @dfn{KDC}, or Key Distribution Center.  The KDC
must be located on a secure machine, since its database contains the
keys for the entire realm.  It is extremely important that the database
be kept secure, if the realm's Kerberos service is to remain secure.

Once a KDC is installed and configured, you may then set up one or more
client machines, and one or more application machines.

Your system's security is only as good as the security of your

system security in addition to installing Kerberos.  Kerberos cannot
protect you from someone who is able to steal @samp{root} privileges.
Kerberos also does not protect you from break-ins caused by bugs in your
daemons (e.g., @samp{fingerd} or @samp{sendmail}).  On almost all Unix
systems, if intruders can break in as an ordinary users, they can become
root by exploiting bugs or imperfect configuration files.


@node Installation on any Machine, Installing the KDC, Background, Installation
@section Installation on any Machine

The following steps must be performed no matter what type of type of
machine (KDC, Client, or Application server) you are installing.  All
machines functioning within the same administrative domain must use the
same Kerberos realm name; and all machines which are using Kerberos must
have Kerberos's configuration files properly installed.

If you are installing Kerberos on a machine which will only act as a
client, this section describes all that you need to do.  If you are
installing a KDC, or an Kerberos Application server, please see 
@ref{Installing the KDC}, or @ref{A Sample Application},
for additional steps.

@subsection Picking a Realm Name

Before you install Kerberos V5 at your site, you have to choose a
@dfn{realm name}, the name that specifies the system's administrative
domain.  By convention, we suggest that you use your internet domain
name, in capital letters.

@strong{WARNING:} The name and syntax of the @file{krb.conf} and
@file{krb.realms} file will be changing before the 1.0 release!

* /etc/services::               
@end menu

@node krb.conf, krb.realms, Configuration files, Configuration files
@subsubsection The @file{krb.conf} File

Create a @file{[KRB5ROOT]/krb.conf} file using the following format:
@example
<realm_name>
<realm_name>   <master_server_name> admin server
@end example

where @samp{realm_name} specifies the system's realm name,
and @samp{master_server_name} specifies the machine name on
which you will run the master server.  The words 'admin server' must
appear next to the name of the server on which you intend to run the
administration server (which must be a machine with access to the database).

For example,
if your realm name is @samp{tim.edu} and your master server's name is
@samp{kerberos.tim.edu}, the file should have these contents:

@example
tim.edu
tim.edu  kerberos.tim.edu admin server
@end example

See the @file{[SOURCE_DIR]/config-files/krb.conf} file for an
example @file{krb.conf} file.  That file has examples of how to
provide backup servers for a given realm (additional lines with the same
leading realm name) and how to designate servers for remote realms.

@node krb.realms, /etc/services, krb.conf, Configuration files
@subsubsection The @file{krb.realms} File

In many situations, the default realm in which a host operates will be
identical to the domain portion its Internet domain name.

If this is not the case, you will need to establish a translation from
host name or domain name to realm name.  This is accomplished with the
@samp{[KRB5ROOT]/krb.realms} file.

Each line of the translation file specifies either a hostname or domain
name, and its associated realm:

@example
.domain.name kerberos.realm1
host.name kerberos.realm2
@end example
For example, to map all hosts in the domain LSC.TIM.EDU to KRB.REALM1
but the host FILMS.LSC.TIM.EDU to KRB.REALM2 your file would read:
@example
.LSC.TIM.EDU KRB.REALM1
FILMS.LSC.TIM.EDU KRB.REALM2
@end example
If a particular host matches both a domain and a host entry, the host
entry takes precedence.

@node     /etc/services,  , krb.realms, Configuration files
@subsubsection /etc/services

All hosts which will use Kerberos will need to have certain ports
defined in the system's @file{/etc/services} file.  The file
@file{[SOURCEDIR]/config-files/services.append} contains the entries
which should be appened to the /etc/services file.

@node Required Programs,  , Configuration files, Installation on any Machine

@end menu

@node Initializing the KDB, Storing the Master Password, Installing the KDC, Installing the KDC
@subsection Initializing the Kerberos Database

Login to the Kerberos KDC, and use the @samp{su} command to become root.
If you installed the Kerberos administration tools 
with the @samp{make install} command and the default pathnames,
they should be in the @file{/krb5/sbin} directory.
If you installed the tools in a different directory,
hopefully you know what it is.
From now on, we will refer to this directory as [ADMIN_DIR].

The @samp{kdb5_create} command creates and initializes the master database.
It asks you to the database's master password.
Do not forget this password.
If you do, the database becomes useless.
(Your realm name should be substituted for [REALMNAME] below.)

Use @samp{kdb5_create} as follows:

@example
# @b{/krb5/sbin/kdb5_create}
Initializing database '/krb5/principal' for realm 'ATHENA.MIT.EDU',
master key name 'K/M@@ATHENA.MIT.EDU'
You will be prompted for the database Master Password.
It is important that you NOT FORGET this password.
Enter KDC database master key:              @b{<-- [Enter the master password.]}
Re-enter KDC database master key to verify: @b{<-- [Re-enter it.]}
@end example


@node Storing the Master Password, Adding Users to the Database, Initializing the KDB, Installing the KDC
@subsection Storing the Master Password

The @samp{kdb5_stash} command "stashes" the master password in the file
@file{/.k.[REALM.NAME]} so that the Kerberos server can be started
automatically during an unattended reboot of the master server.  Other
administrative programs use this hidden password so that they can access
the master database without someone having to manually provide the
master password.  This command is an optional one; if you'd rather enter
the master password each time you start the Kerberos server, don't use
@samp{kdb5_stash}.

One the one hand, if you use @samp{kdb5_stash}, a copy of the master key
will reside on disk which may not be acceptable; on the other hand, if
you don't use @samp{kdb5_stash}, the server cannot be started unless
someone is around to type the password in manually.

The command merely prompts for the master password:

@example
# @b{/krb5/sbin/kdb5_stash}
Enter KDC database master key:    @b{<-- [Enter the master password.]}
@end example

A note about the Kerberos database master key:
if your master key is compromised and the database is obtained,
the security of your entire authentication system is compromised.
The master key must be a carefully kept secret.  If you keep backups,
you must guard all the master keys you use, in case someone has stolen
an old backup and wants to attack users' whose passwords haven't changed
since the backup was stolen.
This is why we provide the option not to store it on disk.

@node Adding Users to the Database, Starting the Kerberos Server, Storing the Master Password, Installing the KDC
@subsection Adding Users to the Database

The @samp{kdb5_edit} program is used to add new users and services to
the master database, and to modify existing database information.

Here we will this program to add yourself to the newly created database

@example
# @b{/krb5/sbin/kdb5_edit}
kdb5_edit:  @b{ank tytso}
Enter password:                        @b{<-- [Enter your password.]}
Re-enter password for verification:    @b{<-- [Re-enter it.]}
kdb5_edit: @b{quit}
@end example

The @samp{ank} command is short for "add_new_key"; this command adds a
new user to the database.  To see what other commands which kdb5_edit
supports, type @kbd{? @key{RET}} at the @samp{kdb5_edit} prompt.

@node Starting the Kerberos Server, The Administration Server, Adding Users to the Database, Installing the KDC
@subsection Starting the Kerberos Server

In order to start the Kerberos server, run it as a background process

@example
# @b{/krb5/sbin/krb5kdc &}
@end example

If you have used the @samp{kdb5_stash} command to store the master database password,
the server will start automatically.
If you did not use @samp{kdb5_stash}, 
use the following command:

@example
# @b{/krb5/sbin/krb5kdc -m}
@end example

The server will prompt you to enter the master password before actually
starting itself.

@node The Administration Server, Testing the Kerberos Server, Starting the Kerberos Server, Installing the KDC
@subsection The Administration Server

There is currently an administration server in the Kerberos source tree.
It is, however, very rough, and it will likely be significantly changed
or replaced before the 1.0 release.

Hence, this manual does not document the current administration server.
Changes to the database can be made by logging in to the KDC directly,
and using the @samp{kdb5_edit} program.

@node Testing the Kerberos Server,  , The Administration Server, Installing the KDC
@subsection Testing the Kerberos Server

Use the @samp{kinit} command obtain Kerberos credentials.  This command
creates your credentials cache and stores your credentials in it.

If you used the default @samp{make install} command and directories to
install the Kerberos user utilities, @samp{kinit} will be in the
@file{/krb5/bin} directory. From now on, we'll refer to the Kerberos user
commands directory as [K_USER].

Use @samp{kinit} as follows:

@example
# @b{[K_USER]/kinit tytso}
Password for tytso.MIT.EDU:              @b{<-- enter tytso's password}
@end example


Use the @samp{klist} program to list the contents of your ticket file.

@example
# @b{[K_USER]/klist}
Ticket cache: /tmp/krb5cc_15806
Default principal: tytso@@ATHENA.MIT.EDU

@node A Sample Application, Common Kerberos Service Names, Installing the KDC, Installation
@section A Sample Application

This release of Kerberos comes with a sample application
server and a corresponding client program.  
You will find this software in the @file{src/appl/sample/sserver} and
@file{src/appl/sample/sclient} directories, which contain the server's
exectable, and the client program's executable, respectively.

The programs are rudimentary.
When they have been installed (the installation procedure is described
in detail later), they work as follows:

@itemize

The user starts @samp{sclient} and provides as arguments
to the command the name of the server machine and an optional port on
which to contact the server.
For instance:
@example
% @b{/u1/krb5/build/appl/sample/sclient/sclient tsx-11.mit.edu}
@end example

@item @samp{sclient} contacts the server machine and
authenticates the user to @samp{sserver}.

@item @samp{sserver} authenticates itself to @samp{sclient} (thus
performing mutual authentication), and 
then returns a message to the client program.
This message contains the name of the Kerberos principal that was used
to authenticate to @samp{sserver}.

@item @samp{sclient} displays the server's message on the user's
terminal screen.
@end itemize

@menu

@end menu

@node Installing the Sample Application, Testing the Sample Server, A Sample Application, A Sample Application
@subsection Installing the Sample Application

In general,
you use the following procedure to install a Kerberos-authenticated
server-client system.

@enumerate

@item Add the appropriate entry to the Kerberos database using @samp{kdb_edit}

@item Create a @file{/etc/v5srvtab} file for the server machine.

@item Install the service program and the @file{/etc/v5srvtab}
file on the server machine.

@item Install the client program on the client machine.

@item Update the @file{/etc/services} file on the client and server machines.
@end enumerate

We will use the sample application as an example, although programs
which do not take requests via the @samp{inetd} program may have
slightly different installation procedures.  @samp{Inetd} starts
@samp{sserver} each time a client process contacts the server machine.
@samp{sserver} processes the request, terminiates, then is restarted
when @samp{inetd} receives another @samp{sserver} request.  When you
install the program on the server, you must add a @samp{sample} entry to
the server machine's @file{/etc/inetd.conf} file.

The following description assumes that you are installing
@samp{sserver} on the machine @samp{jimi.mit.edu}.
Here's the process, step by step:

@enumerate

@item Login as or @samp{su} to root on the Kerberos server machine.
Use the @samp{kdb5_edit} program to create an entry for
@code{sample} in the Kerberos database:

@example
# @b{[ADMIN_DIR]/kdb5_edit}
kdb5_edit: @b{ark sample/jimi.mit.edu}         @b{<-- add_random_key}
kdb5_edit: @b{quit}
@end example

@item Use @samp{kdb5_edit} to create a @file{srvtab} file
for @samp{sserver}'s host machine:

@example
# @b{[ADMIN_DIR]/kdb5_edit}
kdb5_edit: @b{xst jimi.mit.edu sample}         @b{<-- add_random_key}
'sample/jimi.mit.edu@@ATHENA.MIT.EDU' added to keytab 'WRFILE:jimi.mit.edu-new-srvtab'
kdb5_edit: @b{quit}
@end example

Transfer the @file{jimi.mit.edu-new-srvtab} file to @samp{jimi.mit.edu}
and install it as @file{/etc/v5srvtab}.
Note that this file is equivalent to the service's password and should
be treated with care.
For example, it could be transferred by removable media, but should
not be sent over an open network in the clear.
Once installed, this file should be readable only by root.

@item Add the following line to the @file{/etc/services} file on
@samp{jimi.mit.edu}, and on all machines that will run the
@samp{sample_client} program:

@example
sample     906/tcp       # Kerberos sample app server
@end example

@item Add a line similar to the following line to the @file{/etc/inetd.conf}
file on @samp{sample_server}'s machine:

@example
sample   stream   tcp   nowait   switched   root
    [PATH]/sserver sample_server
@end example

where [PATH] should be substituted with
the path to the @samp{sserver} program.
(This @file{inetd.conf} information should be placed on one line.)
You should examine existing lines in @file{/etc/inetd.conf} and use the
same format used by other entries (e.g. for telnet).  Most systems do
not have a column for the `switched' keyword, and some do not have a
column for the username (usually `root', as above).

@item Restart @samp{inetd} by sending the current @samp{inetd} process
a hangup signal:

@example
# @b{kill -HUP} @i{process_id_number}
@end example

@item The @samp{sserver} is now ready to take @samp{sclient} requests.

@end enumerate

@node Testing the Sample Server,  , Installing the Sample Application, A Sample Application
@subsection Testing the Sample Server

Assume that you have installed @samp{sserver} on @samp{jimi.mit.edu}.

Login to your workstation and use the @samp{kinit} command to
obtain a Kerberos ticket-granting ticket:

@example
% @b{[K_USER]/kinit tytso}
Password for tytso@@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:            @b{<--- Enter tytso's password}
@end example

Now use the @samp{sclient} program as follows:

@example
% @b{[PATH]/sclient jimi}
@end example

The command should display something like the following:

@example
sendauth succeeded, reply is:
reply len 29, contents:
You are tytso@@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
@end example

@node Common Kerberos Service Names,  , A Sample Application, Installation
@section Common Kerberos Service Names

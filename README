Beta test distribution READ-ME file.
-----------------------------------

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ``AS IS'' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Now, with that out of the way, let me point you to a few things:

The file doc/TREE-GRAPH is a graphical representation of the source
directory tree you should receive with this distribution.

The file doc/SOURCE-TREE describes what's in each directory.

The file doc/HOW_TO_BUILD gives instructions on how to start build
Kerberos.

We used the ISODE release 8.0 ASN.1 compiler for the code we have run
and tested here at MIT.  If you are using ISODE 6.8, you will need to
apply the patches found in the file tools/pepsy-diffs to fix some bugs
in the PEPSY compiler which have caused us problems.  I believe that
ISODE 8.0 should work without any problems.  However, I have not had a
chance to try it out.

Appreciation Time!!!!  There are far too many people to try to thank
them all; many people have contributed to the development of Kerberos
V5.  This is only a partial listing....  

Thanks to Mark Eichin at Cygnus for writing the new autoconf
configuration system, for making the code much more portable, and for
serving as pre-release testers.

Thanks to Marc Horowitz, Barry Jaspan, and Jonathan Kamens (and
others) at Openvision, Inc. for providing us with an GSS-API library,
for serving as pre-release testers, and for finding and fixing many
bugs (some of them at the last minute!).

Thanks to Cybersafe for providing patches to fix bugs with inter-realm
authentication.  

Thanks to Ari Medivnsky and Cliff Neumann for writing a ksu client.

Thanks to Jim Miller from Suite Software for contributing many detailed
bug reports, most of them by doing desk checks over the code!

Thanks to Prasad Upasani from ISI for porting the Berkeley
rlogin/rsh/rcp suite and for testing out our distribution on the Sun.

Thanks to Glenn Machin and Bill Wrahe from Sandia National Labs for
contributing the kadmin server, plus lots of bugfixes.

Thanks to Bill Sommerfeld from HP for commenting on early Kerberos
interface drafts, suggesting improvements in later coding interfaces,
and finding and fixing many bugs.

Thanks to Paul Borman from Cray for writing the Kerberos v4 to v5 glue
layer and the Kerberos v5 subroutines for telnet.  

Thanks to Dan Bernstein, for providing the replay cache code.  

Thanks to the members of the Kerberos V5 development team at MIT, both
past and present: Jay Berkenbilt, John Carr, Don Davis, Nancy Gilman,
Barry Jaspan, John Kohl, Cliff Neuman, Jon Rochlis, Jeff Schiller, Ted
Ts'o, Tom Yu.
